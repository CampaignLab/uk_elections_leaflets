Three in four people in Hackney North voted against Brexit, but our MP voted to trigger Article 50. We need MPs that will fight extreme Brexit and attacks on public services and the environment. I'm proud to be a product of Hackney and pledge to fight for the NHS, comprehensive education, social housing and a second vote on Brexit."
