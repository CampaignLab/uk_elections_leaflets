    	"policyTitle": "An NHS free at the point of delivery",
    	"policyDescription": "Labour is lying about UKIP and the NHS. It was Labour and the Tories who brought £80 billion of 'private finance (debt)' into the NHS, and Labour bigwigs have proposed charges. UKIP will give £3 billion extra to keep it free."

    	"policyTitle": "No tax on the minimum wage",
    	"policyDescription": "Millions of the poorest workers, who work all week for the minimum wage, should not have to pay income tax at all."
