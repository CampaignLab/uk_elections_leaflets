Nicola Sturgeon is backing plans to invest an extra \u00a39.5 billion in the health service across the UK. For Scotland that would mean an extra \u00a32 billion for the health budget by 2020. The better funded our NHS, the healthier our country will be. Make it happen. On May 7th, vote SNP to make Scotland stronger at Westminster."
