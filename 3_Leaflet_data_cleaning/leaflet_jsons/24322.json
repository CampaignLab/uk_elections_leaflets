I am from a farming background but started my first business aged 22, and have run various businesses since, most successfully, but with one major failure. I have, fortunately, been able to rebuild from this setback. I am a lifelong ex-Conservative voter who no longer believes nor trusts the politicians. UKIP has sensible policies and confidence in the electorate and is the only party delivering a Referendum on Europe."
