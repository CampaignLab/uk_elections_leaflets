Voting at the last general election was Labour 35.3%, Conservatives 23.2% and Lib Dems 22%. When Green and UKIP candidates have stood locally at the last election, they have always received under 5% of votes cast; no way near enough to challenge for the seat. Don't waste your vote. Be clever with your vote to secure much needed change at Westminster."

We must have the ability for local residents to sack an MP, for Parliament to be answerable to common sense, to work for a voting system where every vote is equal. The Liberal Democrats are proposing these measures for the next parliament but they can only be introduced if you elect a Liberal Democrat MP."

We are also seeing record numbers of people going to pre-payment meters to pay for their energy before they use. We need to act now on securing our energy supply for the future. Locally the Lib Dem led council has asked for an urgent review of energy sites in the Lancaster/Morecambe/Heysham region for 10-15% - seeking a 10% reduction in CO2 in 2010. Nationally the Lib Dems are calling for investment in renewable technology to wean economic from job this dependence."

He is experienced, having been elected leader of Lancaster City Council in May 2009 with cross party support from local Councillors. He has a track record of action and not saying away from hard decisions for the long term benefit of the area."
