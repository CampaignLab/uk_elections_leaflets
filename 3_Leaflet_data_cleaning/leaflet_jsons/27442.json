I have seen many changes, from the infrastructure to the changing attitudes of the people, never thinking I could become involved like this. I am disgusted in the way many high ranking people behave, setting no example and infighting with this greed that has engulfed our society. With the support of my wonderful UKIP Hertsmere team, I will fight against all that is wrong with our society today. This I promise."
