Labour will build more affordable housing and secure a fairer deal for private renters. Labour is promising 25 hours of free childcare for 3 and 4 year olds - something many parents tell me they need to make ends meet while they go out to work. I\u2019ve fought for Hackney for 10 years as your MP. At this election we face the choice between continued Tory hardship or Labour. Only Labour will deliver a fairer future for Britain."
