      "tacticalSituation": "The election in Bath is between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. From the analysis I've done, the data gives us a good idea of the choice people face on Thursday 12th December. The UK could be decided by Remainers voting tactically for the Liberal Democrats. Whether the Conservative or the Liberal Democrat wins will come down to how many Labour supporters lend their vote to the Liberal Democrats."

      "brexitEurope": "With the Green Party standing aside to support the Liberal Democrat candidates in many areas, it is pretty clear who many Remainers are now backing. In fact, recent polls show the Liberal Democrats are the most popular party for Remainers. You know from previous elections that a vote for anyone other than the Liberal Democrats can end up with an MP who backs Brexit.",
