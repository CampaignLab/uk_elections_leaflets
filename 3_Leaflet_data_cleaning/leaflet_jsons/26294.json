	"additionalNotes": "Liberal Democrats have made this the greenest Government ever - often opposed by the Conservatives. Renewable energy investment is soaring, we are leading the global agenda on climate change, new homes are zero-carbon, we have started a major tree planting programme, and created the first ever Green Investment Bank. Energy market competition has been transformed - with consumers able to get a better deal. Our new homes are zero-carbon and we've legislated, to no applause, to help people cut their energy bills, weather their homes and install solar panels."
