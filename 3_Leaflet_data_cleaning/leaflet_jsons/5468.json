Without a strong team of SNP MPs, Scotland's priorities can be ignored. The London parties want to cut spending on vital local services. At the same time they will waste \u00a3100 billion on new nuclear weapons. We believe that is the wrong choice. With your help we can make sure local services come first. Scotland needs champions. National champions to protect investment in jobs and public services. And local champions who will work hard to give this community the representation it needs. This time, don\u2019t just vote for a politician, elect a local champion. Vote SNP."
