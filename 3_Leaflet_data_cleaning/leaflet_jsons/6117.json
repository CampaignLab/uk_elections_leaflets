In the last 13 years working people have seen their taxes go up and up and their money wasted. Labour politicians are even talking about new taxes on jobs. Anyone earning between \u00a37,100 and \u00a345,000 will gain up to \u00a3150 a year with the Conservatives' tax reduction plans. Labour\u2019s new taxes on jobs would see the public and thousands of jobs across the export, retail and baking sectors at risk."

The NHS needs these increases because the pressures it is facing as people live longer and need medical treatments have to be met. We are the party that can provide all the treatments and the new medicines you need. At the same time, we will truly protect the freedoms from targets and bureaucracy and we will invest more on research on cancer survival rates."
