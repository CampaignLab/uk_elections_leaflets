Labour have let us down and have had it too easy in Manchester for decades. The Liberal Democrats have no credibility after being part of a Coalition Government that has seen mass, uncontrolled immigration and national debt continue to skyrocket since Labour's economic failures. You have a voice. You can vote for something better. That is UKIP.\nPlease Vote for me on May 7th.\nyours sincerely, Phil Eckersley"
