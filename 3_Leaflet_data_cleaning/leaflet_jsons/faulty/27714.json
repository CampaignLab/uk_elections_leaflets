At the last General Election in 2015, Kevin Brennan won Cardiff West for Welsh Labour with 40.7% of the vote, with the Tories in a strong second place at 25.2%, and Plaid Cymru and UKIP well back on 13.9% and 11%. If you are one of the majority who doesn\u2019t want a Tory MP, then it's best to unite and vote for Kevin as the Welsh Labour candidate on June 8th."

It\u2019s the little things like this which make the difference to the quality of life of our constituents. I can't wait to get back to the important job of representing them against one of the biggest bands in the world, and I will fight for the brightest and the best outcomes for all, passionate about power for our nation but just as passionate about the community and families we serve here in Cardiff West.'"
