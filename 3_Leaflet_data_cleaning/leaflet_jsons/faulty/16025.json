UKIP will increase spending on the NHS by \u00a33bn, funded by our EU contributions and will clamp down on so-called \u201chealth tourism\u201d so that our brilliant doctors and nurses are once more able to concentrate on delivering first class care to the British people. UKIP will reduce foreign aid spending from \u00a311bn to \u00a32bn and use the savings to cut taxes for hard-pressed British families. A UKIP government will prioritise people with local connections in the queue for social housing and implement a ban on non-British nationals exercising the right to buy social housing apart from those foreign nationals who have served in the HM Armed Forces. UKIP will scrap the unjust income tax that hits so many families in Cambridge."
