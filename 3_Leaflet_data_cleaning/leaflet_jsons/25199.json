Sadly all things that seem to have gone. The shameful way we have been deceived about the EU, mass immigration, and locally, HS2, the Calvert incinerator and over development has been totally arrogant. If, like me, you despair at the way our country is run, vote for me on May 7th. Join the People's Army and together Britannia will rule again."
