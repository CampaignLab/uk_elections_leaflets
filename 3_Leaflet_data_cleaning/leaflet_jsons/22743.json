I did live and work overseas for 12 years, having spells in the Middle East, Australia and Africa, including 8 years in Malawi where I built dams and pipelines in remote areas. I returned to Bournemouth 17 years ago and now live near Castlepoint. I work for a local construction firm and I am active in my local Church. People deserve to be represented by a local candidate who is firmly rooted in this area and not a career politician."
