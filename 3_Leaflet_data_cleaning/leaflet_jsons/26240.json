        "content": "The last Labour government extensively used PFI contracts for the NHS and schools, arguing (along with the Conservatives) that the private sector is better at delivering services than the public sector. The Coalition has continued this policy. Currently such contracts have in excess of £250 billion debt – debt which continues to be a burden for many hospitals and which led to the South London NHS Trust going bankrupt in 2012. Labour's manifesto says nothing about PFI, but Greens are committed to ending such back-door privatisation."
