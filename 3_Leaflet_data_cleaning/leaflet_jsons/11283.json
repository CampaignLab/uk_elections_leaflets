        "content": "In just a few weeks we will have the most important election for a generation. Our economy is burdened by huge debts and homes are out of work. Our society is broken by crime and irresponsible behaviour. Our political system is in a mess. We can't go on like this. A Conservative government will take hold action on all fronts. We'll cut Gordon Brown's waste and debt to get our economy moving. We'll support families and back people who work hard, pay their taxes and play by the rules. We'll raise standards in our schools so our children get the education they deserve. We'll mend our broken society by scrapping the perks and cutting the cost of Parliament. Most importantly, we'll take power away from the political elite and give you more control over your life."
