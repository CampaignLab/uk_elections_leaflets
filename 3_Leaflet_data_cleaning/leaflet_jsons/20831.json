He is now a mature student at the University of Northampton. 2. Liberal Democrats are committed to investing in new transport links, more affordable housing, our schools and colleges, flood prevention and energy conservation. As our M.P., Sadik will fight for Northampton to get its share of government funding. 3. Northampton South needs an M.P. with Sadik's background, someone who understands the concerns of ordinary people."
