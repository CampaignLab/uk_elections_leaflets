Our society and institutions are governed by diktat and not by common sense. Our political system is broken by sleaze and irresponsibility. We can get on like this. A Conservative government will take bold action on all fronts. For Gordon Brown waste and debt got our families and people who do the right thing back into previous stability in our society and we will make lives easier for our people as a priority. We need big changes in our political system too. We need the way of cleaning our MP's expenses and let honesty on the job."
