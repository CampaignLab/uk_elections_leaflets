A former translator and Immigration Officer, I now volunteer at a Prestwich food bank. Whitefield, Prestwich and Radcliffe have had the same Labour MP for 18 long years. It's time for a change! Last year's European elections show that it's now a two-horse race. Only UKIP can defeat Labour in Bury South. So don't waste your vote. Help me make history and vote UKIP!"
