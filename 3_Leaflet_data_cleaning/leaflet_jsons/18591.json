I will fight for a better deal for Stafford Hospital to restore much needed services. I oppose HS2 as this unwanted vanity project will cost billions that we simply can’t afford. I will fight to protect our green landscapes and campaign against wind turbines which cost a fortune and don’t even generate much electricity. Time for a change - VOTE UKIP!"
