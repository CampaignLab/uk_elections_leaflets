It's a choice between a Labour government that fights for hardworking families, or five more years of the Tories.\n\nOur NHS is in crisis and families are \u00a31,600 a year worse off under the Tories. They have extreme plans for spending cuts to our NHS and our schools.\n\nLabour's plan for Scotland will deliver a better future for families and protect their NHS with minimum wage, ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, freeze soaring energy prices, deliver a Mansion Tax and a Bankers Bonus Tax.\n\nBut if the Tories are the largest party, they would form another coalition with the Lib Dems and Cameron would stay in Downing Street.\n\nOnly a vote for Labour can stop the Tories becoming the largest party and forming the next government. Only Labour can deliver the change we need."
