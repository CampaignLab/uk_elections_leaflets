In 2014 Bill set out to make the countryside a safer place in which to live and to work. He launched legislation to improve the quality of data recorded by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) in connection with fatal accidents. 'The HSE record details almost every accident but were missing important facts relating to accidents. The Minister agreed and asked the HSE to meet Bill and adopt his suggestions. Bill said: 'What we are all concerned with here is reducing the risk of serious injury or worse, death, and learning the lessons from past accidents. \u2018It will take time for the database to build up but I hope that this will help with the decisions taken now and in the future to cut the risk to farmers, their families and people enjoying the countryside.'"
