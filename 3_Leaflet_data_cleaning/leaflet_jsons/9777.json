                "content": "Richard will be totally transparent about his expenses and will not claim for a second home. He will also hold monthly public meetings so people can question his expenses and how he votes. Richard is the best placed to unseat Gordon Brown\u2019s local MP. The last election was very close in Watford but this time only a Conservative win in Watford will help change the government. Richard is fighting for hard working families in Watford to ensure police are visible on our streets, doctors, teachers and nurses not swamped with Whitehall or EU paperwork."

Our society and institutions are bogged down in bureaucracy. Our ancient system is a shambles. We can't go on like this. A Conservative government will take bold action on all fronts. We'll cut Gordon Brown's waste and debt. We'll back our families and businesses by stopping the jobs tax and freeze petrol in the short term and restore pride in our country. We need big changes in our political system, too. That's why the Conservative's plans to cut the number of MPs and cut the perks and cutting the cost of Parliament. Most importantly, we will take power away from the political elite to give you more control. So that's the choice at this election; five more years of Gordon Brown's tired government making things worse or the change that this country needs with the Conservatives."
