They all sing from the same \"business as usual\" hymn sheet, with policies that favour big business and the wealthiest individuals, whilst ignoring the rising levels of inequality and financial anxiety their policies inflict. People need a party that acts with integrity, treats ordinary people with compassion rather than indifference, and is courageous in tackling social inequality and injustice. To the Green Party, politics means listening to what people want \u2013 helping them achieve it. We are guided by the principles of fairness, inclusivity, honesty, integrity and, most importantly, community \u2013 local people taking the decisions to build the future they want."
