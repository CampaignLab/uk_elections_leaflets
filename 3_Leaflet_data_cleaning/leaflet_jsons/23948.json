He is calling for an evidence-based approach to do 'what works' to cut crime, not just to 'sound tough' or 'play to the gallery'. Nick says 'We want more prisoners to receive meaningful rehabilitation, with better and earlier education and skills assessment. We want to make prisons places where lives are turned around, not where criminals are hardened.'"
