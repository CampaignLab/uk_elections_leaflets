We are working more closely together, with a new cancer and stroke unit planned for Gurnos that will make a difference. Already looking over Merthyr, as part of the Cynon Valley health unit, we have implemented over 150 major health initiatives with a key aim to treat life threatening illnesses by introducing new treatments."
