Labour lost almost a hundred seats in Parliament, giving the Liberal Democrats no real choice but to go into coalition with the Conservatives. This time is different. With polls showing that the Lib Dems are set to lose many seats and that Labour will lose seats to the Scottish Nationalists, many experts now think that Ed Miliband would need to go into coalition with both the Lib Dems and the SNP to become Prime Minister. This would mean chaos for Britain."

Your vote where you live will make a real difference because our constituency is one of those that will determine the outcome of the election.

If we don't then a Labour/Lib Dem/SNP/ assorted independents coalition is a real possibility."
