Please note that some fields have not been filled in due to the image not providing sufficient information (e.g., `constituency`, `otherPartyLeaderCandidate`, etc.). Furthermore, since I can't ascertain whether Nigel Farage is specifically referred to as the party leader within this campaign leaflet, his mention is made based on general knowledge up to April 2023. If this is incorrect as per the leaflet's specific contents, the `partyLeader` field would need adjustment.
