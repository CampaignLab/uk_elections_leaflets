Like many of you, I believe the established parties are no longer fit for purpose. Husband to a Spanish national, and father of dual-national children, I do not feel there is a contradiction between having a positive international outlook and wanting the UK to be free of undemocratic EU rule. I am ready and waiting to fight for the very best public services, safe streets and an economy that works for us all."
