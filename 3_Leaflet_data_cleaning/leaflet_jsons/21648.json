Two weeks ago, Labour\u2019s Deputy Leader Harriet Harman was asked on LBC whom leaders\u2019 debate if her party would be \u201ctougher than the Tories on benefits.\u201d She replied: \u201cI\u2019m happy to go along with that.\u201d Rachel Reeves, Labour\u2019s welfare spokesperson, recently said her party \u201cdoes not want to represent people on benefits.\u201d It\u2019s shocking: people on benefits include pensioners, parents, people with disabilities, long-term ill and millions of people in work. Ed Balls, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, said he\u2019d make the same cuts as the Tories. It\u2019s clearer than ever that Labour aren\u2019t the party they were. They deserted their core voters decades ago and they show no sign of returning to the values and ideology they once embodied. So who should you vote for? If you want a party and a representative who will fight for a fair society and equality of opportunity for all, then vote for the Liberal Democrats."
