The voters of West Oxfordshire have a rare opportunity to create a shock-wave on May 7th, by supporting UKIP. If you want a fair EU referendum, rather than the broken promises of our PM; if you want us to sort out the A40 logjams once and for all; and if you want to stop the plan to build 10,500 houses across this rural constituency; SHOW that you want a radical change for the better by voting UKIP."
