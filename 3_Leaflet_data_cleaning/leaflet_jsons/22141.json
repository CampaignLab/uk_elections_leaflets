UKIP speak up for people whom politicians aren't listening. Many people are unhappy about the EU, don't support foreign wars and worry about immigration. UKIP is the ONLY party that thinks that living standards are falling, and doubt is wrong, foreign aid does any good. Please vote for UKIP on May 7th."
