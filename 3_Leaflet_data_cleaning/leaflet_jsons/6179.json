Our society is broken by crime and irresponsible behaviour. Our political system is in a mess. We can't go on like this. A Conservative government will take bold action on all fronts. We'll cut Gordon Brown's waste and debt to get our economy moving. We'll support families and back people who do the right thing to encourage responsibility in our society and we'll make sure pensioners are supported as well."
