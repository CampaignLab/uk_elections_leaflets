Politicians always say 'this election is the most important' but this time we might be right. The outcome next month, in seats like this especially, will set the course of our country for many years. Of course there are plenty of issues at stake; this is a General Election after all, but few face the winter poll in a generation because of the stalemate in Westminster around Brexit. I could not have been clearer, and more consistent since 2016 but, for ease and to avoid any doubt, let me summarize where I stand; I voted (and campaigned for) remain in 2016 but, as I said in the House of Commons just last month, I have come to recognise we're seriously selling the country a dud almost."
