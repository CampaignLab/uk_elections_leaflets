Last year people here voted for me to represent them in Brussels and now I am asking you to do so again and elect me to Westminster. Falkirk has been let down and taken for granted by Labour and the SNP and deserves real representation. I will fight for Falkirk's interests but I will do my fighting in Westminster's chamber not in its bars. Make a difference - vote David Coburn and UKIP on May 7th."
