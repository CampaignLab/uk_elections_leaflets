Our hospitals don\u2019t have enough doctors and nurses. Council tax bills keep going up, but public services keep going down. If you want more of the same that we\u2019ve had for the last 20 years, then vote Labour. Now, if you want change, if you want good jobs, great schools, a working NHS, and politicians that put you first, vote for Brexit Party. Together we can change politics for good."
