There's now cooperation in government, open discussion about differences instead of party unity and ensuing splits between wets and drys, Blairites and Brownites, etc.\n\nI believe in a grown-up politics, where you acknowledge other people's arguments and accept you might sometimes be wrong. But then I've lived and worked in the real world and know that the 'Westminster bubble' is not real.\n\nI really hope you can vote for me and my party on 7 May.\n\nPaul Chandler"
