Many people, rather than feeling duped to using their vote, are keener to rip up their polling cards. A Conservative government will clean up with new sanctions so that MPs can no longer vote on their own pay, pensions and expenses. Stephen and his wife Fiona have also bought a family home in the constituency. They have shown that the Stephen hopes about is one he puts back for the good of the whole community, not for himself."

For Stephen, that means better discipline, higher standards of teaching, changing how our schools are run after his own children pass the  11+ as well as how they are taught life skills of our children."

Anyone who uses our road network regularly knows that the what the unaccountable quangos set up by this government are clearly are not up to the task. Money is pouring into other government projects further east. Businesses in Lincolnshire need to make the next government aware of the situation before the HSMP. Assuming that we get our fair share of public funding for key infrastructure that's there to make sure that determined charities and enterprise will get home."
