It is the only home I have and I have deep roots in this community. In the five years I have represented you I have secured three new free schools, I have secured investment in Junction 30 where the A13 meets the M25. I have fought successfully for extensions to the residents discount for the Dartford Crossing. I led the campaign for change at Basildon Hospital and I have fought against proposals for the new Lower Thames Crossing in Thurrock."
