A local NHS that's there when we need it. Plenty of good quality jobs so that everyone in Sheffield can get on in life.\n\nThat's why so many local people - even lifelong Labour supporters - felt so let down by Gordon Brown and the last Labour Government. Labour had such an opportunity to make a positive difference to our public services, but they wasted it, and let us down."

We stopped them letting schools be run for profit, and we stopped them letting businesses fire their staff without even a reason why."

You and I both know that a Conservative-only Government would cut far too much, and hit Sheffield's schools and hospitals.
