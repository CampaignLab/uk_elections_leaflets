        "content": "Dear [Redacted], I've been a secondary school teacher for the last 15 years. Over the last decade I've seen how the Tories have been letting down our schools and our children. That's why I'm writing to you today to ask you to think carefully about how you vote on 12 December. You can't trust Boris Johnson to properly fund our schools. Conservative cuts mean many head teachers are barely able to keep their schools' budgets afloat. Teachers are committed to giving the kids they teach as much as they can, but with time and budgets stretched, they are often digging into their own pockets to provide their students with the basics, there's a limit to what they've got left to give. On 12 December I'll be voting Labour. For investment in our children's futures, for an education system that's free to use from cradle to grave, and for 30 hours' free childcare for all two to four year olds, so every child has the best start in life and parents get the support they need. Lots of people think Brexit is the only thing that matters at this election, but there's any number of other issues at stake too. Please think about our children's futures when you cast your vote on 12 December. Yours sincerely, Jen Nolan Teacher"
