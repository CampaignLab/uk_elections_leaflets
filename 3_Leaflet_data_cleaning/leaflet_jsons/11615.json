You might be fed up with politics, especially given what has happened over the last 12 months, but I urge you to complete and return the ballot paper as soon as possible.\nBroxtowe is a marginal seat so your vote really can make a difference. Please don't leave voting Conservative to somebody else - they may be leaving it to you.\nI would like to give you four good reasons to vote for me:"
