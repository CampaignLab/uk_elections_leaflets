I run a small business importing raw materials from China. My job has shown me first-hand the damage the European Union is doing to British people and jobs. UKIP though is not just about Europe. UKIP has a broad range of policies such as controlling immigration, protecting the National Health Service and improving transport in Bolton. Support us on May 7 and get the recovery underway in Bolton."
