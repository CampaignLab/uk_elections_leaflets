        "content": "Whether you are a tenant or an owner, your flat can be both your biggest asset or your biggest expense. In Southport there is a pattern of spiraling utility charges and ground landlords and insurance companies forcing service and other charges up. John Pugh and his team have dealt with many cases like this and with some success, getting unfair service charges reassessed or reduced. John invited to Southport extra help from the professional Leasehold Advisory Service. John took up the cudgels too for people in sheltered housing facing new charges for wardens and reduced service."

        "content": "Not so long ago your ground landlord could force you by law to change your home insurance to a more expensive company. He got a fee and you got a bigger bill. John Pugh argued for a change in the law. A new clause in the 2002 Leasehold Act which until then had been largely concerned with London short leases. It took a while for the law preventing this to come into full force but now you do have the legal right to choose your own insurance company."
