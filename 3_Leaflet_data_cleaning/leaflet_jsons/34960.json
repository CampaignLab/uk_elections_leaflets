Tactical website from Best for Britain, www.getvoting.org, shows that nearly 200 seats across the UK could be decided by Labour supporters voting tactically for the Liberal Democrats. The Liberal Democrats have the best chance to win seats from the Conservatives, keeping them from a majority. But only if enough Labour supporters back the Liberal Democrats this time."
