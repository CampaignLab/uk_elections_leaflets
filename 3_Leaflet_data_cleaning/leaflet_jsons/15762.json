Helped create nearly 3,000 local new jobs. Leads the campaign to scrap the Tory 'Bedroom Tax'. Increased the Basic State Pension. Leads the campaign against treating Cornwall as 'developers' paradise'. Led the Fair Fuel campaign. Won 5p per litre road duty cut for the Scillies, now pressing to extend this to rural Cornwall. Stopped Tory plans to pay Cornish workers less. Leads the campaign to put 'patients before profit' in the NHS. Successfully campaigned to promote fair trade for farmers and growers."
