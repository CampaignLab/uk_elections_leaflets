Our society is broken by crime and irresponsible behaviour. Our political system is in a mess. We can't go on like this. A Conservative government will take bold action on all fronts. We'll cut Gordon Brown's waste and debt to get our economy moving. We'll support families and back people who do the right thing to encourage responsibility in our society and we'll make sure pensioners are supported as well. And we need big changes in our political system too. We've led the way on cleaning up MPs' expenses and we'll finish the job by scrapping the perks and cutting the cost of Parliament. Most importantly, we'll take power away from the political elite to give you more control over your life. So that's the choice at this election: five more years of Gordon Brown's tired government making things worse or the change this country needs with the Conservatives."
