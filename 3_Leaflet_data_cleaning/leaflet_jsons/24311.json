Labour bankrupts the country EVERY time they form a government. The Conservatives routinely break manifesto promises on the referendum, immigration, the deficit and the NHS. Voting UKIP gets policies for working people and cuts wasteful projects like HS2. I will protect local interests such as Crossrail, local school performance, Adult education and our beleaguered hospitals."
