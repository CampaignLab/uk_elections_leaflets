But since Labour opened our doors in 2004, net migration has risen to 300,000 a year. This means that the strain on our NHS, on school places, on housing demand, have all risen, without us being able to cope with that demand. UKIP isn\u2019t AGAINST anyone. We understand that if you\u2019re a Lithuanian labourer \u2013 where the minimum wage is about \u00a31.30 an hour \u2013 Britain looks like an entirely attractive prospect. We should be proud that we have a country that people want to come to. But we should make sure we\u2019re looking after our own people first."

But please, if you read just one thing, read this one. It may surprise you. There's just around a month to go before you get to march yourself down to the polling station and cast your vote to decide the future of our country. There's even less time if you're a postal voter! Suddenly, for the first time in five years, the local Tories claim they care about Medway. But let's face it; the Labour Party is no better."
