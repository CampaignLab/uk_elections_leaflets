Five more years of austerity and local government cuts from George Osborne will mean that our Council has no resources for anything but social care and the Conservatives will use this as a reason to merge us with Hampshire. The real voice of the Island is rarely heard in Westminster and Whitehall and my job will be to listen and put forward your views. I would use my influence within the next Labour Government to ensure that the benefits of Labour's Plan For Growth and extra resources from clamping down on tax avoidance come to the Island. A well planned new deal for Seaside Towns and Rural Areas is needed."
