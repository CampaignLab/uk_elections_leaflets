He has successfully campaigned on a variety of issues of great concern to West Ham residents, such as the quality of our street environment, the need to tackle anti-social behaviour and the need to address the demand for high-quality housing across the borough which doesn't have an adverse impact on our schools, roads and health services. For Patrick, being a Conservative is about bringing communities together and supporting the least advantaged in society but also generating the sort of wealth for people who want to get on in life. His interests outside work and politics include socialising with friends, running, playing tennis and going to watch England play rugby at Twickenham.",
