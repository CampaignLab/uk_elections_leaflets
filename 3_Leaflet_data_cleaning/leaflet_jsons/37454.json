Welsh Conservative policy is to directly fund schools, cutting out bureaucratic local education authorities which will save \u00a3100 million every year \u2013 funding which can go directly to schools. Russell believes that more power should be handed over to schools to make decisions over their future and giving them control over their budgets. Russell opposes the options supported by the Liberal Democrats, and believes that Llanidoes, Newtown, Caereinion, Llanfyllin, Ysgol Bro Ddyfi and Welshpool should retain their sixth forms."

The Welsh Assembly Government has designated Mid Wales as suitable for large scale wind farm development with little thought to transportation implications and the effect on our communities. Welsh Conservatives are the only party in the Welsh Assembly to oppose large scale wind farms. If elected, Russell will take the opposite view from Mick Bates, the outgoing AM for Montgomeryshire, and bring pressure on Ministers to have this disgraceful policy withdrawn and redrafted."

In March, Russell led a delegation to the Welsh Assembly to deliver a petition of over 10,000 names asking for an early start date for the bypass. He is now pleased to announce that on 29th March the Transport Minister confirmed that construction of the bypass will start in 2013. This is a success for Montgomeryshire, However, Russell has pledged that he will continue to fight until the roundabout is actually rebuilt and the first vehicle has driven onto the Bypass. Welsh Conservative leader Nick Bourne has confirmed Newtown Bypass is a high priority and is fully committed to delivering this urgent scheme for the region."
