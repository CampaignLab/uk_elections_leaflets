We will cut NHS bureaucracy by a third and get the money to the front line. Our new Cancer Drugs Fund will mean that everyone can have access to the cancer drugs their doctors think will help them."

Labour's jobs tax will kill the recovery so we'll cut waste to stop it. 7 out of 10 working people will be better off than under Labour - and nobody will be worse off. And we'll cut Labour's debt to stop higher interest rates and your mortgage going up. We'll cut wasteful spending, like paying welfare benefits to people who could and should be at work, and scrapping huge, unnecessary government projects like ID cards. And we'll control public spending carefully to make sure we can protect our public services. Most importantly, we'll get the economy growing again. We will support small businesses and the self-employed, scrap taxes on new jobs created by new companies, and create 400,000 new training places."
