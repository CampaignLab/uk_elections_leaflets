UKIP is described as a people’s army and that’s why I feel so comfortable in this great party; I am just a member of the community - not a career politician. If we, the people, do not take politics into our own hands, we will continue to be at the mercy of those elites, who demonstrate constantly, that they seek to rule us, rather than serve us. I think many people now realise this."
