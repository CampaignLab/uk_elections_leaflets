Now I seek your support for re-election, this time for the new seat of Hampstead & Kilburn. Representing such a diverse, energetic and exciting constituency is a privilege and never, ever, boring. I've always aimed to reflect my constituent's interests and stood by my principles and beliefs - even when it meant going against my own party. This election is a clear choice between a fairer future under Labour, or a Conservative Party that would favour the wealthy few."
