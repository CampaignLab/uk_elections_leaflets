UKIP will give power back to the people and allow politicians to work for the communities that elected them. It's time to stop spending so much money on foreign aid, foreign wars and foreign institutions. It's time to put our local communities first, protect vital public services and improve our NHS. A vote for UKIP is a vote for change. We believe in building a Britain that works for everyone. Yours sincerely, Ethan Wilkinson"
