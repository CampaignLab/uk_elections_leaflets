This cannot happen if the needs of our own citizens are not taken into account - and our own heritage and culture considered by others to be offensive. An end to rampant political correctness and health and safety culture would forge genuine unity. Political correctness itself creates racism and discrimination - usually in the form of self-hate and apologism. We are who we are and this needs to be respected."
