As your MP the NHS will be my top priority. I want consistently excellent healthcare and I\u2019ll use my career experience to help \u2013 but the NHS also depends on a strong economy. I\u2019ll campaign to get the balance right on development. We need homes for the next generation, but we mustn\u2019t destroy rural Kent in the process."
