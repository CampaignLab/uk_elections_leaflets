In 2010, the UK was in crisis. Now: -the fastest growth in the EU; -falling unemployment; -the deficit cut by 1/3; - and 2.7 million paying lower tax. Perhaps you are nor a regular Conservative voter? But can you afford a return to rising trot, and uncertainty again? Best wishes, Yours, [signature]"
