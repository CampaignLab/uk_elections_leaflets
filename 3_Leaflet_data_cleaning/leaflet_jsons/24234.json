        "content": "Bristol has been my home for the last thirty years. I came here to study history at Bristol University and have been living and working in our great community ever since. I've dedicated my life to public service - as an advisor to independent family businesses, not coming from a privileged background myself and I experienced harsh poverty. I know how the school made me the success. Determined to succeed and tenacious in my studies, with crucial support from teachers at school gave me the confidence to do well and aim high."

I am proud that the Liberal Democrats are saying the NHS should have an additional £8 billion it needs. It's on the front of our manifesto, along with another cut in income tax for the low paid. It's a party of government we have protected civil liberties, fought to protect nature, improve public transport and reduce carbon emissions."
