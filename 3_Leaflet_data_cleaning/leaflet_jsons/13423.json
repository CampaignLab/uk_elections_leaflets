That's why Labour will stop people claiming benefits until they have lived here for at least two years. Those who have lost control of our borders have no idea who is coming in or out of the country. That's why Labour will bring in 1,000 extra border staff to cut people in and out of the country as we fingerprint checks to clamp down on illegal immigration. People who rely on public services have a right to expect that staff, like nurses and care workers, can speak English. That is why Labour will make sure that all frontline public sector staff can speak English."
