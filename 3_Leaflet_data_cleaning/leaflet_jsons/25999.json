    "personalStatement": "Gulnar is a self-employed mother of two who has studied, lived and worked in London for 24 years. After spending a year in Istanbul she saw how a wonderful city can be ruined, and the rights of communities ignored, if a strong Green voice is not championing the environment issues such as transport, affordable housing and access to green spaces. This is what inspired her to become more active in local campaigning when she and her family moved back to London in 2013.",
