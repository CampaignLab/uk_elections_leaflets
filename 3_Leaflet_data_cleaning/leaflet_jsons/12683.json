At the last Scottish Parliament election he substantially increased the SNP vote and the SNP ran the Liberal Democrats to within 1800 votes on the party list vote, ahead of the Tories. Whether Labour or Tory emerge as the largest party at Westminster; only the SNP offers a real alternative and will stand up for Scotland in the difficult times ahead, he believes."
