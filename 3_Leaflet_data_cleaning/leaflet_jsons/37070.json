In the next Assembly term our task is to invest in jobs and our young people and support a brighter future for the communities and businesses of this region. In the face of big cuts by the UK Tories I will lead Welsh Labour's team in standing up for Wales. We will stand up for our Coastguard Service, investment in jobs, health services, the rural economy, broadband and transport. Vote Welsh Labour twice on 5 May."
