I support a new bridge across the Thames and I am in favour of a new outer ring road incorporating a better managed M4. I strongly support encouraging businesses to start up and or move to Reading. I see this as a fantastic way to get our young people working in rewarding jobs that will pay well and secure the towns long term future. However, housing shortages worry me and I would do more to endorse the use of brown field sites as a solution to our affordable housing problem."
