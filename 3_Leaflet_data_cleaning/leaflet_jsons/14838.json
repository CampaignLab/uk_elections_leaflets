    "additionalNotes": "Under the Tories: Immediate cuts would put recovery at risk. The Tories won't match our commitment to protect investment in frontline policing and schools. The Tories would cut Child Tax Credits and the Child Trust Fund for families on modest and middle incomes. The Tory priority is a tax cut for the 3000 richest people in Britain. The Lib Dems want an amnesty for illegal immigrants; The Lib Dems would cut Child Tax Credits and scrap the Child Trust Fund; Nick Clegg won't rule out a coalition with the Tories."
