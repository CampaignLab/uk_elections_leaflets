She works hard to speak to people across the constituency, offering a positive message of Labour's plan to invest in our NHS, reduce the cost of living, increase wages and regulate zero-hours contracts. In her professional life, Sally has made a real difference; winning the introduction of a national minimum wage for apprentices across the UK and making sure the government does much more to tackle tax dodging."
