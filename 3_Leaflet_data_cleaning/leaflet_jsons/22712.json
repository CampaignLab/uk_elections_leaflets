    "personalStatement": "I have lived in Staffordshire most of my life, going to school in Stafford. I lived in Swynnerton in the 1990s before moving to Clayton in Newcastle under Lyme, on the edge of Stone constituency, where I now live. I was a civil servant for 37 years before retiring a few years ago.\n\nI know some people now disagree, but I think Lib Dems were right to go into a coalition. For five years we have tried hard to keep our coalition partners on the straight and narrow. We have been able to implement several of our key policies.",
