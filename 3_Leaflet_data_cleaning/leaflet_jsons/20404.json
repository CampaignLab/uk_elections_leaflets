I hold regular surgeries at my office and around the constituency to ensure I remain accessible. I have and will work with local parents to open new Free Schools and Academies. After being elected one of my 1st actions was to persuade the Mayor of London to spend \u00a38m on upgrading Henlys Corner. The new layout has improved traffic flow immensely. The NHS has been a significant part of my work and I was delighted to have persuaded the Government to commit \u00a328m to rebuild Finchley Memorial Hospital and I continue to campaign for a permanent breast screening Unit. If re-elected, I will continue to be a strong voice for local people."
