Together we intend to tackle austerity with a strong plan for the wealth generated and the wealth distributed to become more properly shared. We will start to ease family burdens, and begin to build larger employments to strengthen our services and protect a country where the potential and passion of each person is the wealth of a nation. We work better together. David"
