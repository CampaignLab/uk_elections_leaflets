He has the skills and experience to do the job and will be a hardworking, honest public servant with integrity and fairness at core values. 2. Real-world experience vs. a shiny faced 20-something university student or a beer-gargling, working in a factory town MP! Metropolitan police officer (working in Vice, Drugs, Murder, Riot and Organised Crime Squads) and a successful private sector career. 3. George understands the constituency. He walks the beat in Holborn & Kings Cross (dealing with the homeless or in Lincoln\u2019s Inn fields) and helping casualties at the Kings Cross fire, He understands what that makes this area special."
