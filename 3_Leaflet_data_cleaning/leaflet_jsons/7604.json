Society is corrupted by state control, it uses bureaucracy a lot and destroy rather than to protect and create a better society. Birmingham has too much legislation, is economically backward. We must address this. The UK has no class transport; so much that it is rendered unworkable. We have no criminal justice system, leads to the streets controlled by people patronage and quangos support this by crushing people and their aspirations. Political patronage is corrupting, wasteful and degrading, Council tax is too high and mostly wasted; this is a disgrace."
