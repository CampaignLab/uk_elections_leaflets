	"personalStatement": "I've lived in Rossendale for over 30 years and I'm standing for Parliament because I agree with those who opposed the Iraq invasion, wanted a vote on the Lisbon Treaty and think that prison sentences should fully reflect the crime. This Labour Government has ignored them. But it isn't only Labour that has let us down. The Conservatives privatised our energy and water companies. Massive profits from these now go abroad every year instead of being re-invested here. They and we now pay vastly more for poorer services.",
