I am asking for your support in May because I will be a Member of Parliament rooted within our community, focused on making a real difference and prepared to stand up for local residents. Inside, I explain how we can build a fairer Hertford and Stortford. I'm out on the doorstep regularly and I am looking forward to carrying on the conversation between now and the General Election a few days away."
