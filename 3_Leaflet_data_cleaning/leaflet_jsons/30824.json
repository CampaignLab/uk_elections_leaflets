But just remember the opinion polls got the General Election wrong in 2015. They got the EU referendum wrong, and as Jeremy Corbyn has said himself, he was a 200-1 outside chance for the Labour leadership. So in the days of shock election results and global uncertainty, no one can ever really be sure who will win. And with so much at stake, let's not risk it."

Making Brexit a success is central to our national interest - and it is crucial to your own security and prosperity. While there is enormous opportunity for Britain as we leave the European Union, if we do not get this right the consequences will be serious. And they will be felt by ordinary, working people across the country. If we don't get the Brexit deal right, your economic security and prosperity will be put at risk, and the opportunities you seek for your family will simply be jeopardised."

Or a hung parliament and coalition of chaos with Jeremy Corbyn. A hung parliament and coalition of chaos will threaten our Brexit negotiations, and every single one of us will pay for it in higher taxes, fewer jobs, more waste and more debt."
