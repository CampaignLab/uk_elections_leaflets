I've campaigned hard on the issues you've told me matter â€“ securing jobs, investing in local infrastructure and tackling crime and anti-social behaviour. As your MP, I'll find solutions to the problems we face and build on the progress we've made. With crime rates down, unemployment down and national debt reduction across our area, this election is your chance to elect a strong local champion to build on these achievements."
