At the General Election in just a few weeks time, families face a big choice about the future of our region. It's a choice between a Labour Government that will fight for hardworking families, or five more years of the Tories... Only electing a Labour MP on May 7th can stop the Tories and deliver the change we need. Best wishes, Russell Brown"
