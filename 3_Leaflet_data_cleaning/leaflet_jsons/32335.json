Some of Britain's staunchest Leave seats are 'represented' by Labour Remainers. Yet there are around 150 Parliamentary seats that the Tories have not won for at least 50 years \u2013 and can't win in this election. In the May European Election, The Brexit Party won more votes than Labour and the Tories combined. The Brexit Party can beat Corbyn's Remainer Labour in the Brexit heartlands."
