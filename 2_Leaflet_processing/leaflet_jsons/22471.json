I am standing to be your Member of Parliament because I believe that North Tyneside deserves a champion who isn't afraid to take on the wasteful and complacent Labour council, who will not increase the already regressive council tax by 24% and hit the residents harder. As your MP, I would ensure that your voice is heard and that you get value for money from your representatives."
