Voting Conservative in Bury South on 7th May will simply let Labour back in. Not to mention the Scottish Nationalists! So I respectfully request that on this occasion you LEND ME YOUR SUPPORT - VOTE UKIP. If you previously pinned your hopes on the Liberal Democrats, the party of broken promises, MAKE THEM PAY - VOTE UKIP."
