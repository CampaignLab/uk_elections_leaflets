Like you, I have been left feeling disenfranchised by the other parties after watching them fall short. When elected this government promised to take control of immigration, that we would have a referendum on the EU and that there would be no increase on tuition fees. We have all been taken for granted by the cozy political class. This time, vote for real change - Vote UKIP."
