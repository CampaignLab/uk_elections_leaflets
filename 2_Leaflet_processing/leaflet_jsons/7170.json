The Labour Government has invested in our NHS and schools and acted decisively in response to the economic downturn, to protect people's homes, jobs and secure our recovery. Remember the last recession? The Tories left people on the scrapheap, with 15% interest rates and more than three million unemployed. Now is the time to put Islwyn's hardworking people first. Instead, the Tories' priority is to give millionaires a tax cut - meaning slashed spending for the rest of us and endangering our economic recovery. The Tories are a change we cannot afford."
