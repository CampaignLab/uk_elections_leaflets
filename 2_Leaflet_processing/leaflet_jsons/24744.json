I want an NHS free at the point of delivery, extra money spent on Doctors and Nurses NOT Managers. Perhaps you remember the current Bury North Tory MP's 'vow' to keep our local maternity unit open? Or the Labour MP before him, who was sent to prison for stealing Â£18 000 of OUR money? The right to Vote was hard won so this May, vote UKIP. Vote Ian Henderson in Bury North yours sincerely, Ian Henderson"
