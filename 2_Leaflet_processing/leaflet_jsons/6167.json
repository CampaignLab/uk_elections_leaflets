This emphasises the degree to which the will of the people is held in contempt. I would like to see more police on the streets controlling antisocial behaviour and a reduction in their time-consuming paperwork. I will campaign for regular meetings between the police and residents to ensure that policing methods are as flexible and effective as possible in meeting the needs of the community."
