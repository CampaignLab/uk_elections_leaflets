But you would never think so listening to the other political parties, who barely mention it. Hurricanes and droughts, floods and rising sea levels, massive loss of wildlife and marine species – we all know these are just the beginning and we cannot carry on as before. Our children and grandchildren will face much worse with hundreds of millions of people moving across the world in search of land, water and safety. In Brighton, between the South Downs and the sea, we face loud wake-up calls too: fracking beneath the Downs, losing greenfield sites in the Deans, increasing air pollution and eroding cliffs. Globally, the powerful business interests that promote fossil fuels and blind consumerism are leading the attack on our environment. These are the same vested interests that presided over the economic crash and now support cuts to public services and justify shocking levels of inequality.",
