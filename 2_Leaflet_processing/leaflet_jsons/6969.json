The economy is in turmoil yet Gordon Brown still gives billions of pounds we haven't got to the EU, the carbon trading scam and as subsidies to inefficient wind farms. The fact is Cameron and Clegg would do the same. With the Lib/Lab/Con we will stay in the EU. With the lies and deceit of our MPs how can we trust them to right the wrong? It is time to kick them out. If elected I would happily work for half a current MP's pay. It's time to vote out the lunatics."
