But I came to the conclusion that if you want to change things for the better, you have the energy, experience and voice to bring people together, then you have to play your part.\nI’m not a career politician – far from it! For 19 years I worked in industry, the last six running my own manufacturing business. If you want your next MP to be someone with real life experience – vote for me."
