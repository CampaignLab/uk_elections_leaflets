The Tories want to make deep cuts in public spending and look after the interests of the wealthy few. I'll fight to stop cuts in services and to reform the banks and the finance sector. Don't let the Tories in the back door. If you re-elect me I'll work hard for our area, stand up for local people and put your interests first."
