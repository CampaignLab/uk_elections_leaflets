With your help I will fight to end Hospital Car Parking charges and safeguard our A&E services. We need to rein in property developers who seem hell-bent on destroying our green spaces. We should be protecting our rural heritage not ending it. My intention will always be to protect hard working families, small businesses and the vulnerable."
