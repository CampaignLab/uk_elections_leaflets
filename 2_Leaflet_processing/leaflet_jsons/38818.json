    "additionalNotes": "The leaflet highlights the Liberal Democrats' opposition to Brexit and frames the election as a choice between the Conservatives' damaging Brexit and Liberal Democrat's promise to stop Brexit. Mentions that recent polls show support for the Liberal Democrats is at record levels and Jo Swinson is the most popular party leader. Suggests that MPs from Labour and the Conservatives are joining the Lib Dems, citing broken politics and two old parties repeatedly failing."
