Labour will tackle the housing crisis by guaranteeing that we will build 200,000 homes a year by 2020, creating jobs in the construction industry. We will also offer a fairer deal to families on Housing Benefit by abolishing the bedroom tax, establishing a national register of landlords, capping rents and ending rip-off fees and charges."

We will slash university fees by a third, we will expand apprenticeships with the aim that by 2025 as many young people will start an apprenticeship as go to university, and we will help our unemployed younger people back to work with a guaranteed job or training for 18-24 year olds out of work for a year or more."

A service of local meetings needs to be useful that people will continue to fight counties like Dorset and Rachel will continue to fight the cuts and fragmentation that are currently threatening our own buses. The lack of affordable housing in Dorset has been a problem for many years and Rachel is committed to working with local communities to develop affordable homes to rent and buy."

For young people like myself, fair pay is badly needed, especially when the cost of living, particularly food, is spiraling out of control. I know that Rachel will campaign strongly to help combat the trend driven by the many and not the few."

She will speak up for West Dorset on the important principle of putting patient health and social care before profit together with my background in the health service. Dorset's ageing population will increase by 30% by 2025 so it is essential that we provide after-care for patients in their own homes. Rachel supports Labourâ€™s plan to cut waiting times and the pledge which promises GP appointments within 48 hours."
