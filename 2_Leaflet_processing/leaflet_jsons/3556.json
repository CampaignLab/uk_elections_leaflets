        "title": "Goodbye Ipswich Buses?",
        "content": "The Tories and Liberal Democrats plan to sell off shares in Ipswich Buses to a private operator. This has happened in other parts of the country, fares have gone up and services have become less frequent and less reliable. Ipswich Buses has been owned by the People of Ipswich for over 100 years but the Tories and Liberals haven't bothered to ask us what we think about their plans."

They met local residents who have organised a petition to improve road safety outside Rushmere Hall School and the Wooden House Children's Centre, and at dangerous crossings. They looked at ways to improve the condition of Lanark Road, and Alasdair and Lindsey have added their support to their campaign."

        "content": "At a recent planning meeting Tory and Liberal Councillors supported proposals for a new 'Tesco' store in Grafton Way in spite of warnings by local businesses that this would harm the ‘vibrant’ town centre. Labour opposed the suggestion as they fear that extra traffic congestion will result, and provide no reassurance that the decision should be overturned."
