It comes at a time when our economy is in deep trouble, we need to mend our broken society and rebuild trust in our political system. We can't go on like this. Britain needs change to get the country back on its feet - to heal the mistakes of the past and bring new ideas and energy for our future."

    	"content": "As every family knows, the longer you leave a debt, the more serious the problem, the worse it gets. I want a better future for Tynemouth Constituency with its stunning coastline, iconic landmarks, cultural heritage and real communities is a great place to live - but I believe it could be even better. People have told me they are concerned about jobs, the cost of living; debt and its implications for the future; and the loss of local amenities including Post Offices. This recession has changed not only the way we live but our quality of life. Savings rates have plummeted; leaving many pensioners worried how they will pay their bills. I want our streets to be safer and the regeneration of our town centres to continue."
