        "content": "The National Minimum Wage is one of the proudest achievements of the last Labour governmentâ€”raising pay at the bottom of the wage distribution. Philip Davies has said that 'people with a learning disability, by definition, cannot be as productive in their work as somebody who has not got a disability of that nature' and used this to argue that they should be able to offer to work for less than minimum wage (Guardian, 23 June 2011). I reject Mr Davies' suggestion that disabled people should be prepared to 'accept less than the minimum wage' because 'I believe that the most vulnerable do deserve that protection from exploitation.'"
