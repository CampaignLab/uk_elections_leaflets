The Tories also objected, using the opportunity to attack the then action of the Labour Government. But now that reduced ticket office hours are being proposed by the Tory Mayor and his Transport for London, the local Conservatives have fallen silent. Do they believe that Network rail stations need staffed ticket offices but tube stations don't?"
