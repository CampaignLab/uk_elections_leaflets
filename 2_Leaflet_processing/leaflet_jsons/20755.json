Living in Blackhall Colliery, I see many problems: unemployment, crime, empty shops and a total lack of government help. That’s why I want to be your local MP instead - to hold Parliament to account and ensure politicians think about Easington. Labour have held this seat for 93 years. It’s time for a change. Only UKIP offers a real challenge; we promise to work hard for local people."
