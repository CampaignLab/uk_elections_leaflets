Action will be taken to ban rip-off letting agents' fees for tenants, saving renters an average of Â£350 in costs each time they move. Introduction of a self-funded national register of landlords will drive up standards across the sector and there will be a new target of upgraded energy efficiency to privately rented properties."

A Labour government will change the law to make three-year tenancies the norm and protect against excessive rent increases to give working families the stability they deserve and we'll take action to ban rip-off letting agents' fees for tenants.",

He emphasizes the need for proper alternative transport options and mentions the possibility of a greater role for Transport for London."
