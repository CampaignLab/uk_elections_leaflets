My aims are to respond to and address the issues of concern within our communities. I am especially concerned with seeing that the elderly get the help and support they are denied. Tory welfare cuts are pushing inner London residents to our area. The labour council's response seems to be to build on every green space. I will resist both. It's time Lewisham fulfilled its potential."
