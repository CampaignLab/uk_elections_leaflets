        "content": "Over the past four years the SNP government has worked hard to deliver real progress. It has succeeded. Achievements include world leading climate change legislation, crime at a 32-year low and council tax frozen. Primary classes are now the smallest on record, free education has been restored for students and thanks to the dedication of NHS staff waiting times are shorter than ever. These are firm foundations to build on, but there is much more to do. Scotland is a country with considerable resources. With the highest ever government revenues from North Sea Oil, we must harness Scotland's wealth to benefit all of our people. We need real power for Scotland â€“ to drive economic growth, create more successful businesses and more jobs in a sustainable way to invest in our public services. I am ambitious for our city and for our country. I want to help build the kind of city and Scotland we deserve. With your support on May 5th we can win Edinburgh Southern and make Scotland better."
