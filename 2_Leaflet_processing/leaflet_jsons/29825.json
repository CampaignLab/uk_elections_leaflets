My freedom of information request revealed they want to build between 500 and 1000 temporary homes over the various car parks in the area. They also withdrew the Northwick Park Pavilion from the 'Community Asset Transfer' while refusing to say what alternative plans they have for the building in the middle of the playing fields."
