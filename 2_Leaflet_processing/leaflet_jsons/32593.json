To save our High Streets by reducing rates for small traders and taxing fairly online traders like Amazon. To re-open the Skipton to Colne rail line and to restore Ripon's rail link. We need to provide efficient local train and bus services not a clumsy mess of different competing companies and vanity projects. To invest in modern northern industries and to get our region at the forefront of the upcoming wave of fresh new low carbon businesses. To protect local people, local businesses and local farmers from a post Brexit trade deal with Donald Trump."
