Top polling company YouGov have released a prediction for the result here in Oxford West & Abingdon constituency that puts Lib Dem Layla Moran and the right wing Conservative Nicola Blackwood absolutely neck and neck. The prediction is based on carefully analysed polling results from this constituency and others along with demographic modelling. With the Greens having stood down to allow Layla Moran a clear run against the Tories, Labour voters will now be crucial. If they decide to vote Labour on Thursday they will help the Conservatives win this seat. If they decide to lend their vote to Layla Moran, the right wing Conservatives will be beaten."
