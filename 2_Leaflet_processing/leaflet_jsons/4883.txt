Please note that the text in the image is too small to read with certainty, and hence some fields have remained empty. This JSON reflects the discernible sections and information, but lacks details such as exact policy descriptions, personal statements, political experience, contact information, etc., which could not be extracted from the provided image due to resolution constraints.
