I have worked as a fitness instructor for many years. Our broken political system has failed to deliver the Brexit that 52 percent of us voted for. Like many, I have lost trust in politics. As your MP I would build homes on brownfield sites to help solve the housing crisis. Whether fighting for Brexit and democracy, or standing up for local people, I will be a strong voice for Glasgow North."
