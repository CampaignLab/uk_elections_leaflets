        "content": "Thinking about voting for Labour at the upcoming General Election? I urge you to think again. Two weeks ago, Labour’s Deputy Leader Harriet Harman was asked on LBC whom leaders’ debate if her party would be “tougher than the Tories on benefits.” She replied: “I’m happy to go along with that.” Rachel Reeves, Labour’s welfare spokesperson, recently said her party “does not want to represent people on benefits.” It’s shocking: people on benefits include pensioners, parents, people with disabilities, long-term ill and millions of people in work. Ed Balls, Labour’s shadow chancellor, said he’d make the same cuts as the Tories. It’s clearer than ever that Labour aren’t the party they were. They deserted their core voters decades ago and they show no sign of returning to the values and ideology they once embodied. So who should you vote for? If you want a party and a representative who will fight for a fair society and equality of opportunity for all, then vote for the Liberal Democrats."
