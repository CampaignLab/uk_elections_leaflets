The Winter Fuel Allowance, Cold Weather Payments, Pension Credits, free TV Licences for over 75s and free bus travel have helped make life that bit better for pensioners in our area. Our Families: People lead ever more busy lives and expect the government to do more to help balance caring, working and living. Labour has made it our priority to support families - in work, in their pockets and in giving children the best start in life. Our Community: I was born and bred, educated, and proud to live here. Glasgow North East needs a strong local voice for all our people here in the community. I'm proud of our area and want the best for all our families"
