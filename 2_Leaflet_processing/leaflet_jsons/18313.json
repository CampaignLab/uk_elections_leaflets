I have worked continuously to get a fairer deal for Suffolk residents on funding for health and hospitals, for our schools, for broadband and for our coastal defenses. I kept my pledge to pensioners. I fought successfully to stop the A14 toll and still secured the road improvements. With your support, I will keep working hard to keep Suffolk special."
