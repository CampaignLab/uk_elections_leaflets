However, the result of the election with the appalling state of the economy left the Liberal Democrats with little choice. Believe us, coalition with the Conservatives was not a very desirable outcome for us either. Sadly, some of our key policies such as the Mansion Tax (now stolen by Labour) and the abolition of student fees were unacceptable to the Conservatives.",
