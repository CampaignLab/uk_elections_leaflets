I have lost three very close friends to alcohol, yet this drug is legal and promoted to excess on footballers' shirts and on the TV. Most people know that criminalising drugs does not make them go away. Instead it often multiplies the damage they cause many times over. We need to manage drug consumption in the same way that we manage tobacco use -- by controlling its real cost and availability in a way that actually works."
