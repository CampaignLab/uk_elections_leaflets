    "additionalNotes": "Nick Clegg discusses the failures of the current government and positions the Liberal Democrats as a vehicle for real change. There is a dissatisfaction expressed with both Labour and Conservative parties. The leaflet implies a call for action by asking for support to deliver 'real change' and suggests strategic voting, as Conservatives are claimed to be unable to win in many parts of Britain."
