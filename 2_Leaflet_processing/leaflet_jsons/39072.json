Also, to guard recriters, help-paid, and long-term jobs in sectors such as social care, and also, as tourism recovers, we must protect hospitality workers by improving pay and conditions and tackling insecurity in the gig economy."

        "policyTitle": "Housing",
        "policyDescription": "Make it a human right and too expensive for many people to stay in our city. The housing market is out of control in Edinburgh, and we need to rebalance power in favor of people who live here. That means ending rents, regulating short-term lets, investing in social housing, and ending homelessness for good."

We're at its limits, parks, schools, or the services that support vulnerable groupsâ€”our council has to be able to meet local needs. I'm calling for a new deal for local government that keeps services open, protects council jobs and supports our communities to thrive."

        "policyTitle": "Climate",
        "policyDescription": "The climate crisis is the biggest challenge of this generation and it's clear a business-as-usual approach just won't cut it. Scotland has the resources to lead the world in a just transition to renewable energy, but in a socialised model local councils like ours get homes to protect people from fuel poverty. It's time to do what it takes to meet net zero. If Scotland leads, and protecting our green spaces for the health of our planet."

Education Recovery: Develop a catch-up plan which invests in schools, and ensures IT support in every primary and secondary.
