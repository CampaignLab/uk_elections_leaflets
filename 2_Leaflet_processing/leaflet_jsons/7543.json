        "policyDescription": "Flooding is Kensington's hidden danger. Homes and lives were damaged in 2007, and the constituency remains vulnerable. Better flood defences are needed as a matter of urgency. Malcolm has been working to help those affected and defend those who are threatened. Over Â£27.5 million of investment to protect endangered properties and lay the groundwork for a major development at Counters Creek. This is just the start, as further funds ought to be granted within the next five years. These improvements have been a long time coming. Progress required the appeals of local residents, the expertise of Thames Water, and the favourable stance of Ofwat. Malcolm has been one of those leading this effort and is determined to see further improvements come into effect."

        "policyTitle": "FINDING ALTERNATIVES TO HEATHROW EXPANSION",
        "policyDescription": "Heathrow was never designed to be London's main airport. It is not connected to the country's main train lines. Planes must fly over the city's residential areas, causing great disturbance. The Heathrow site is also unsuitable for expansion. Malcolm will push for a transport policy that is in the interests of Kensington. That might include a new airport in the Thames Estuary. The potential benefits of such a project are clear. It would reduce noise, air and road traffic within the city, and could be connected to the main train network."
