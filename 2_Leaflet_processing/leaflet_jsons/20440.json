We have all had enough of Tory cuts to the armed forces, police and essential services. They have incentivised councils to build massive housing developments without proper infrastructure. They have increased immigration to 624,000 per annum, foreign aid to £12 billion, VAT to 20% and the National Debt to £1.5 trillion. It is time for real change. Please give UKIP the balance of power in Westminster on May 7th."
