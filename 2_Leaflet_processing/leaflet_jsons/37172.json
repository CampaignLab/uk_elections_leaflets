Now we've got a strategy and ambition, the priority for the coming years must be to use its full potential. In these tough times Wales needs: a strong and ambitious party in government, not more of the same from Labour. We've shown what we can do to protect Wales during the difficult years and it's now time to do more. Raising standards in schools, creating new jobs, electrifying the Valleys Lines, building more green affordable homes and improving our health care must be the priority. If you want an ambitious Welsh Government to get on with the job, then vote for it."
