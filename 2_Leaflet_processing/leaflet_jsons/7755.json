        "content": "The Montgomeryshire countryside is a special place. It's very special to me. I have always lived here. I still manage the family farming business created by my father. The Welsh countryside has always been an inspiration, and during my 9 years as Assembly Member from 1999 to 2007, I chaired the committee responsible for rural and environmental issues. Improving services, including transport and broadband, would be at the heart of my work as your Member of Parliament."

        "content": "Montgomeryshire's public services are under threat as never before. Our social infrastructure is in danger of being hollowed out. National policy changes have indeed public money away from rural areas, and health services are under a far greater strain than anywhere else. Montgomeryshire needs an MP who will be a strong champion of our public services we depend on. Most of our community hospitals are struggling to maintain services, and there could be worse to come, unless we fight to stop it."

The economy of Central Wales is being held back by traffic problems in Newtown. There will be a huge role for Welsh MPs to liaise with the National Assembly for Wales to deliver a fair deal for rural Wales."
