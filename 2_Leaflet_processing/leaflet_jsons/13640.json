        "content": "1. Unlike Frank Dobson George is not a career politician. He has the skills and experience to do the job and will be a hands-on, visible public servant with integrity and fairness as core values. 2. Real world experience. A Shawty town beginnings, working in a factory aged 9. A Metropolitan Police officer working in Vice, Drugs, Murder, Riot, and Organised Crime Squads; and a successful private sector career. 3. George understands this constituency. He walked the beats in Holborn & Kings Cross dealing with the homeless in Lincolnâ€™s Inn and squatters at the Kings Cross Fire. He understands what makes this area special."

        "content": "In just a few weeks we will have the most important election for a generation. Our economy is in its longest and deepest recession in 70 years. Our society is broken by crime and irresponsible behaviour. Our public services are in a mess. We can't go on like this. A Conservative government will take bold action on all fronts. We'll cut Gordon Brown's waste and debt to get our economy moving. We will support families and back people who do the right thing. We will raise standards in our schools and support small businesses so we create jobs as well as save money."
