I campaigned to prevent Royal Mail privatisation and against the London Mayorâ€™s plans to cut police on our streets. I also closed Wanstead Police Station and close tube station ticket offices. I have taken my petitions against these cuts door to door and stood outside every tube station in the constituency during protests against the campaigns."

It has been an enormous privilege to serve and I hope you will agree I have a proven reputation of dedication that extends beyond campaigning and the walls of election, putting in the hard work for local residents. I am therefore now seeking your support to re-elect me on 7 May 2015.\nI hope that you will do me the honour of continuing to support me in my efforts to resist the attacks on working people and public services by this government and to try to win power and secure a Labour government in May."
