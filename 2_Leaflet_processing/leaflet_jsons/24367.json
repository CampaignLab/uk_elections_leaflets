I've known Gordon Lindhurst for a long time and he's a man of principle with a record of service. He's someone residents can rely on to fight their corner. Unlike other candidates standing, Gordon is local. He knows the issues we face because he's here, living amongst us. And in Parliament, I've seen him take on the Scottish Government, to get results for local residents. I would urge everyone to get behind him this Thursday."
