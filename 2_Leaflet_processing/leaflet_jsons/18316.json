As a chartered accountant, he has worked for a variety of companies, large and small, both in the UK and abroad and he now wants to work for you as a labour MP. The teenage son of immigrants, I understand the two new states with nothing and what it takes, through education and hard work, to integrate into a new society. My varied life experiences, including unemployment and illnesses, have made me passionate about improving the lives of the ordinary, hard-working majority in our society, not just the privileged few."
