Whether the Conservative or the Liberal Democrat wins will come down to how many Labour supporters lend their vote to the Liberal Democrats. The Liberal Democrats have the best chance to win seats from the Conservatives, keeping them from a majority. But only if enough Labour supporters back the Liberal Democrats this time."
