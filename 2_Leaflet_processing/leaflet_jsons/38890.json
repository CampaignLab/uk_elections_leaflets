Over the last decade we've seen the country go in the wrong direction: there have been too many cutbacks in essential public services and too many people dependant on food banks to get by. Brexit would only make things worse, and I'm committed to campaigning for 'remain' in a future vote on a Brexit deal – which only a Labour government can guarantee.\n\nVoting Tory or Lib Dem is a vote for more of the same. Labour offers this country the change it needs."
