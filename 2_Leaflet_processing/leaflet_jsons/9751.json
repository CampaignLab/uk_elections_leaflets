    	"content": "Dear Peter, At this election you are choosing your next Scottish MP in the House of Commons. And now, more than ever, Scotland - and this area - needs a champion at Westminster. A local champion to give you and this community strong and effective representation. And a national champion, because without the SNP, Scotland's interests can be ignored. The more SNP MPs there are, the more we can achieve for the people of Scotland. We can win a better deal for our nation and protect local services from the worst impact of spending cuts. The Tory SNP cut this will be \"deeper and tougher\" than under Margaret Thatcher. The Tories and Labour say their cuts are too. We say there is another way. Protect investment in jobs and local services. Instead cut spending on the £100 billion replacement for Trident nuclear submarines, the £5 billion ID card programme, or the £100 million House of Lords. As your MP, I will work hard to make sure your voice and Scotland's voice is heard. Together, we can make sure the system works for this area, not against it. With your support we can protect the things that matter most. Yours sincerely, Calum Cashley"
