Local doctors have closed surgeries or reduced the hours they open Occident and Emergency was under such pressure in January that Great Western hospital cancelled operations and was so desperate for space they put up a tent for patients. This is simply not good enough, and making sure the NHS is there for you and your family will be a priority for me as your MP. A Labour government will provide 8,000 more doctors and 20,000 more nurses and guarantee a GP appointment within 48 hours.",
