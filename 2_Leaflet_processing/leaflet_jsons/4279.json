I have been frustrated by the constant running down of public services in Enfield, such as the downgrading of Chase Farm Hospital, the closure of post offices and police having to spend more time on paperwork than patrolling the streets. At this time when we're paying more taxes than ever, this all has to stop and needs everything else second."

        "content": "The general election is just weeks away now. This is a big moment for Britain. It comes at a time when our economy is in deep trouble, we need to mend our broken society and rebuild trust in our political system. We can't go on like this; Britain needs change to get the country back on its feet - to heal the mistakes of the past and bring new ideas and energy for our future. This can be the year for changeâ€”and the Conservatives have the plans to make that a reality."
