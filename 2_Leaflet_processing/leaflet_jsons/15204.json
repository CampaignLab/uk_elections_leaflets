    "personalStatement": "I was born in Southend; my family were part of Southend life: my mother played piano in pubs, her relatives ran a fish restaurant, barber shop and penny arcade. After qualifying as an engineer, I served in the Royal Air Force for 21 years. Worked in the IT industry for as many years since. In 2013, after years of frustration at the way we are governed I joined UKIP, never having been a member of a political party before. I am standing as your UKIP candidate on 7th May 2015. Please join me and help to make history, changing Westminster politics, forever.",
