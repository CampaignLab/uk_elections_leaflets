I'm married to Karel with two daughters, a police officer and a student nurse. Local and national democracy has broken down and I want to put that right, I'm not afraid to speak my mind and engage people at every level. The people of Tynemouth don't have a strong voice in Westminster, a voice that represents the people of Tynemouth. I'm passionate about campaigning for what local people deserve across our community."
