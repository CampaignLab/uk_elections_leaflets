If elected on May 7th, I'll work with Ruth Davidson and the Scottish Conservative team to restore the UK economy, continue to grow our economy, create jobs, keep welfare under control and safeguard our union with the backbone of respect for all. Electing a Scottish Conservative MP will help deliver a fair deal and ensure that only the Conservatives can keep our economy growing and our country together. Vote for me on May 7th to elect a local champion who will make Glasgow South's voice heard at Westminster."
