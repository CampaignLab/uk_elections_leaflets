        "content": "I'm honoured to be your Labour Parliamentary Candidate for Nottingham East. Born and bred in Nottingham, growing up in a single-parent household under austerity, I understand the daily injustices we face. Under a Tory government, we've seen rents rise, wages stagnate, and our schools and hospitals reach breaking point. And as a local hate crime worker, I know that our communities need to be healed and empowered by a better project of justice. It's time for real change. For too long, we've been ignored by politics in Nottingham. As your MP, I will be accessible and accountable to you; I will continue living in Nottingham, support progressive struggles, and take only the average UK full-time wage of £35,000 – donating the rest to local causes."
