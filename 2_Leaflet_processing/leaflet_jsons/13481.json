Official figures show that Scotland's NHS is under huge pressure as it struggles to cope with the increasing demand on its services. More than half of Scottish hospitals are missing the A&E waiting times target, and figures for NHS Ayrshire and Arran show that A&E waiting times have increased over the past year."
