More and more people are switching to back Lib Dem campaigner Wendy Taylor to deliver fair taxes and get things done. Every vote for Wendy is a vote for real action on jobs, on crime, on schools and the NHS, and the environment. Only the Lib Dems are promising fairer local spending, student fees, and real political change."
