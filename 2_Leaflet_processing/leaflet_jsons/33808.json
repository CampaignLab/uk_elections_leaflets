In the last three years, other political parties have said one thing on Brexit and then done another. Will this time be different? Sovereignty belongs to the people. Parliament should have no power to reduce it or steal it from us. Constitutional changes that have such an effect must be for the electorate to decide. Itâ€™s time to bring power back to the people. Geoff"
