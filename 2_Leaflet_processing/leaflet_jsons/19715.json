Your MP should promote small business over big corporations; encourage science, engineering and enterprise and press for better policing and defence. Savings on EU costs and foreign aid would mean extra for the NHS, schools and debt repayment - interest on debt exceeds our defence budget. If you believe in Britain, vote for change in East Surrey. Yours sincerely, Helena Windsor"
