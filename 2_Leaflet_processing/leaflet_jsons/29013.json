Green Councillor have received a legal opinion from the council. Laws indicates that Network Rail will own the bridge must pay to stop the pigeon nuisance. Pedestrians and cyclists have had to brave poo raining down from the bridge since the netting was taken down Autumn 2015. Despite repeated attempts to persuade Network Rail to fulfil its obligations, it has failed to do so. Martin Luckhurst thanked the Council's legal team for giving clear-cut evidence that Network Rail are responsible and said 'If this pigeon poo problem was affecting the suits of Senior Executives at Network Rail, it would have been sorted out by now. My message to them is 'we're not giving up until this is fixed. It's time for you to accept responsibility and take action.'"
