More than ever before we need a government that serves the nation and its people; one that takes action to sustain our economy, cares for all groups in society and protects our borders. That is what voting Labour means. The priorities of other parties will not ensure that everyone is looked after. They will damage our public services - health, education, transport and the environment - and drastically reduce support for those in need."

        "title": "Standing up for what is right",
        "content": "Opposing the Iraq war - I opposed UK involvement in the Iraq War and voted four times in Parliament against military action. The Labour Party whips were not happy but I believe it was right - and I still do. Speaking up for pensioners - I spoke up in parliament in support of compensation for Equitable Life policyholders, many of whom are Leeds North East residents who had seen their savings shrink by more than half since the collapse of the company. This is simply about justice for persons who have been badly let down by poor regulation. Supporting freedom and justice worldwide - As a member of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee since 2001, I have visited some of the poorest and most war torn countries in the world. This has strengthened my commitment to ensure that the government continues to offer help and support for the poorest people worldwide."
