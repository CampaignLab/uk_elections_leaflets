I campaigned to Leave the EU in the referendum, and ever since I have been fighting to uphold that decision. For three and a half years opposition has been unrelenting from the well-funded Remain lobby and our political elite. The vote to Leave was the largest ever vote in the UK's history, and by deliberate obstruction it is not being delivered. This is indeed the Brexit election, but more importantly this is about defending democracy itself. Regardless of how you voted in 2016, the Leave vote must be enacted, otherwise what majority decision will be safe?"
