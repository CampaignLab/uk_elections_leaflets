We will see a happier and more prosperous Britain. The majority here in Huddersfield, as in the country, voted LEAVE. Many MPs, including Barry Sheerman, have ignored the democratic will by delaying Brexit. Our Parliamentary democracy was the envy of the world, but this delay is making us a laughing stock. Only a Conservative Government can, and will, end this uncertainty by delivering Brexit. The only way to vote Conservative is on December 12th."
