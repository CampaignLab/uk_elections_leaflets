So it makes me furious that the Tories would scrap Labour's two-week cancer referral guarantee. We created the NHS, our investment has brought waiting lists down, and now we'll create personal healthcare guarantees for all patients."

That's why, as part of our Kyoto target, we've invested millions of pounds to lay the foundations for a new low-carbon economy. Now our blueprint for future industries could create 1.2m green jobs in renewables, nuclear power and clean coal."

I'm against their cuts to front-line services that do such a good job - 60,000 people are on the beat. But the Tories' cuts would take 3,500 police out of our streets and erode DNA database, making it harder for them to do their jobs."
