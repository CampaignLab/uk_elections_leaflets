But a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition. If you re-elect me as your MP, I will introduce a calm, rational and moderate, voice into the debate on our country's future. Most voters do not want to see a one-party state. They want to see constructive and sensible opposition. I have the passion, determination and commitment to be your voice in Parliament. I very much hope you will give me the opportunity to represent our local community again."
