I have worked hard to be the strong local voice I promised to be, to stick up for our patch and bring change where I can. I am passionate about what the Labour Party stands for - fairness, equality and concern for our neighbours. I have aimed to stand up for our community in Parliament, rebuild trust in politics and work to address the inequality and injustice that exists in our communities. I have tried to show that it is possible to be a politician with integrity, who can be trusted, and who will work tirelessly for our community. On 7 May I hope you will place your trust in me again."
