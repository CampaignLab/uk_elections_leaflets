        "content": "This is the most important election for a generation. In 2010, our economy was in peril. We turned it around and the result is millions of new jobs and apprenticeships. Education and welfare systems were failing. We brought in strong reforms that have put them on the path of success. Systems for control of the British people demanded a referendum on our membership of the European Union and we will deliver one. However, the job is far from done. A vote for me is a vote to finish what we have started. For a strong and effective MP, vote Richard Benyon on 7th May."
