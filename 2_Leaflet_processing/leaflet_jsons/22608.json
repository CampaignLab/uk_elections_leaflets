That's more than we spend today on all our schools put together and four times what we spend on our police. It means they will have to make deep cuts to everything from nurseries and social care to police and the armed services. The saddest thing is that it is not necessary; we can balance the books at the end of the Parliament without that level of pain. Conservatives are making a deliberate ideological choice, a choice which the Liberal Democrats have stopped them making during the past five years."
