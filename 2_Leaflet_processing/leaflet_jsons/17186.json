Its public transport is inadequate, with roads at a standstill. Air quality is dangerously poor. Vital public services that support and protect the most vulnerable members of our society are being cut. Next door to affluence is poverty and deprivation, and our children have very different lives depending on where they live."

        "content": "I believe in protecting our environment, in social justice, and a thriving economy based on independent business and local jobs. Public services should be run for people, not the profits of private corporations. We need a free, publicly funded NHS and an end to creeping privatisation. We need a proper public transport service that takes railway and bus services back into public ownership. We have to scrap tuition fees, so everyone has access to a world-class state education system without getting into crippling debt. People need a living wage, affordable homes and real opportunity."
