        "content": "Cambridge and Britain face a choice: five more years of Cameron and Clegg, a cost of living crisis and a struggling NHS or a Labour Government delivering a recovery that works for working people. Too many Cambridge people are struggling to pay the bills, it's getting harder to see a GP, young people are frustrated when an unpaid internship follows a good quality education rather than a good job and older people are worried about paying for care in old age. We live in a divided city where some are writing the digital future, while others are left behind and are forced to rely on food banks."
