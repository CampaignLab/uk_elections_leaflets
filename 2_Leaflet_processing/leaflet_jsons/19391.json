I have worked all of my adult life, being employed in engineering, the steel industry, as a publican and now with National Express. I have experienced the lows of poverty when young and spent time as a Barnardo's boy. I learned some hard lessons then that have held me in good stead since. It is my intention to promote open and engaged politics with you at the very core of it always. I will be your voice locally and nationally."
