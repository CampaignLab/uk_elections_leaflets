Â£3bn wasted on reorganisation they promised wouldn't happen. The Lib Dems have backed the Tories all the way. Backed the Tories' NHS privatisation agenda. Backed Cameron's damaging NHS reorganisation. Put private profit before patient care. UKIP want to scrap our free NHS. Nigel Farage wants a US-style healthcare system, not a free NHS. This would mean huge bills for patients. UKIP would charge you to see your GP."
