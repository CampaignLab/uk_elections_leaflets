Over the next month or so you will get a lot of pieces of paper pushed through your letterbox, and all sorts of people knocking at your door, everyone asking for your vote. Looking back on the last few years, I won't pretend it's all been easy. Although we've won a few battles for local people and that's what matters, over the last few months politics has been rough going, and for good reason. When you look at the way some MPs have behaved, no wonder people have lost confidence. I am as angry as I'm sure you are at those who abused the expenses system."
