I love the area and I am proud of our community. During the last 18 years in Parliament I have worked hard on the issues that you have told me are important to you. That includes fighting for a sound economy, that rewards hard-working families, good jobs, education, health and housing, and measures to help children and the environment. I am, and have always been, on your side."
