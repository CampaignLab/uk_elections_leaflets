With the spectre of mass unemployment, where the culture of greed has brought the financial system to its knees, while those who are responsible continue to be paid their massive bonuses. At the same time we are having to live with the massive effects of Climate Change and environmental degradation. And, of course, the scandal of MPs expenses."
