A change to clean up Westminster sleaze. A change to cut the taxes of ordinary families.\n\nThat’s what the Liberal Democrats are offering this time.\n\nIn many parts of Britain, only the Liberal Democrats can defeat Gordon Brown and Labour.\n\nIn these areas, voting Conservative can't change anything. In fact it could help Labour edge home again. Every last vote will be vital.\n\nOnly a vote in the ballot box for the Liberal Democrats can beat Labour this time.\n\nI believe that it’s time to do things differently in Britain. People are fed up with seeing Labour and the Conservatives taking it in turns and failing to deliver. That’s what got Britain where it is today - broken politics and the worst national debt ever.\n\nWith the Liberal Democrats, you will get decisive action to clean up politics. We will cut Labour's waste so that we can pay back the deficit while protecting public services.\n\nPut your trust in us and together we can change Britain.\n\nThanks and best wishes,\n\nNick Clegg\n\nPS - Don't forget, your vote could decide between five more years of Gordon Brown OR real change with the Liberal Democrats."
