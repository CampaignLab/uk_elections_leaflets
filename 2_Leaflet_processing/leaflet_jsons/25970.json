	"personalStatement": "It’s crucial you make your voice heard. By Doreen Lawrence.\n\nI’ve spent the last few months visiting communities across the UK, talking about the crucial General Election coming up. I’ve been speaking with people from all different backgrounds to ensure that their passion, their voice, and their concerns matter to them. \n\nDespite the many passionate conversations I’ve had, more than ever, too many people feel like their voices aren’t being heard. They’re being told the economy is improving, but they’re feeling less secure in their jobs and seeing their public services cut. Younger people in particular say they're working hard, but can't see the training and job opportunities they need.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Government’s hasty reforms have meant that fewer people have been registered to vote than before. Many younger people, who have been let down most by this Government, still aren’t able to vote and Ed Miliband has rightly been addressing this with a drive to register a million missing voters.",
