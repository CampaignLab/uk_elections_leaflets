If elected I would work tirelessly to ensure the problems at Tameside Hospital are eradicated and campaign for Matrons to return to the wards to tackle cleanliness issues and fight against MRSA. With crime on the increase, we need to urgently address the criminal justice system in this country. I would seek to demand a return to serious policing and a re-balance of the law to protect residents who defend their own homes, families or property against intruders. The rights of criminals should never be more important than the rights of victims and sentences should mean what they say. Life should mean life."
