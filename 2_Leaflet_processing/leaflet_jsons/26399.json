This could only be a benefit to the constituency.\n\nI believe that local resources and services should be a priority, that money should be invested locally and not wasted on the EU, Foreign Aid and Foreign Wars.\n\nI will fight to see an end to benefit and health tourism. This Government is devoid of common sense. Lets make sense by voting UKIP!"
