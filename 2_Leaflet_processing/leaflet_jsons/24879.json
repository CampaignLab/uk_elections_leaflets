        "content": "I believe that we face a real challenge to get a better deal for the people of Lancaster and Fleetwood. I have lived in the area for over 15 years and like many people I have watched with concern as things seem to go from bad to worse. I have had enough of bankers being bailed out and corporations avoiding paying their fair share of tax. I am appalled about the lack of action to tackle climate change, and I'm concerned at the sight of the rich getting even richer while the number of people using foodbanks continues to rise. I trained as a carpenter and have worked in the construction industry all my working life becoming a site and project manager."
