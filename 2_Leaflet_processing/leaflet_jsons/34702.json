        "content": "Dear Residents, I am Ellie Green, and I would like to ask you to vote for me in the coming general election. I grew up in Chapel St Leonards, went to Skegness Grammar School and now live in Louth. It is our local services, our schools, businesses, healthcare, and social care that I am passionate about. I want to add to the beautiful landscapes by working locally in libraries, retail and bringing more diverse funding to business, so more skilled workers are available. It is time to return the educational government so councils can respond to local needs, looking at each individual school for improvement; restore our local accountability to schools and reclaim them from academy trusts. It's time for councils to return to building and letting council homes for all. I believe in a fair benefits system that helps people get back into work and can put people into long-term food banks or living on the streets. I've worked in the Job Centre and have seen the hardships faced by our most vulnerable. I cherish walking my cocker spaniel Barley along the beaches and fields of our worlds and coast. Protecting our environment offers many opportunities for the area. I would support the ploughing cycle of the fields and spring of Butterflies and Birds; look at wetland for the farmers and rural communities. People have spoken to be the guru of the environment."
