Voted with the Labour Government to double the rate of tax paid by the poorest people in order to fund a tax cut for the rich. Voted to waste billions of pounds of our money on an ineffective ID Card scheme, rather than investing money in more police to cut crime. Repaid over Â£7000 of taxpayers' money at the height of the MPs' expenses scandal, and then complained about having to return the money."
