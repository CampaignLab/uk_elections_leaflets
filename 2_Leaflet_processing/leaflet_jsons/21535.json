What we need on Tyneside, the UK and all over the world is a GREEN revolution. I am a GREENIST and GREENISM is the great leap forward that our society needs to make. It is not to the left, the right or the centre it is beyond. The leap into a GREENER future will not be easy, and it will not be immediate, but it is necessary if the societies of the world are to be there for our children and the generations to come. Only GREEN party candidates offer a sustainable, happy, healthy future based on community need rather than individual greed. So vote for me, Martin Collins, to be your representative in Parliament on May 7th.\""
