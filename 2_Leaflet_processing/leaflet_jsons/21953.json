She has helped highlight the dangers cuts, that the UKIP Tory and Lib-Dem Councillors voted through, will affect public safety. These cuts mean we'll lose a third of our fire engine. As a firefighter the safety of my crew is more important than our job title or pay grade. So for me itâ€™s an easy choice to vote for Nancy because she cares. She has been a great friend to us as we've fought to save Sussex Fire and Rescue Service."

His government has shown contempt for NHS staff from increasing visas and pushing the privatisation of health services. I'm voting for Nancy because I know she will fight to save the NHS for ordinary people who rely on it."
