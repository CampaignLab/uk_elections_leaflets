They wasted £3 billion on a damaging NHS reorganisation and cut staff. Our NHS doctors and nurses are fantastic but they have been badly let down. The facts are very worrying: 60% of people say they can't get a GP appointment within two days while more people are being left waiting on trolleys at A&E."
