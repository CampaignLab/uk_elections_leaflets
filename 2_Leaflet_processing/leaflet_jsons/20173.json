I worked in banking & financial services before setting up a small property maintenance company, which I still run. I joined UKIP fighting against bank bailouts & refusal by the political classes to allow the people to have a say on whether the UK should be a sovereign state or be absorbed into an undemocratic EU super state about the green belt & democracy.",
