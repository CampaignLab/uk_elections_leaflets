Over the past Parliament: he campaigned over 10,000 constituents with which he has helped; and carried 10,000 caseloads that he has started to improve for local people. If re-elected this May, Bob will: push for a strong and protected healthcare service; deliver new and powerful health authorities; continue to work to help improve mental health services in Colchester for the next 15 years; create more jobs and apprenticeships; ensure local people have job offers and apprenticeships to help rebuild from Covid; strive to continue to support local businesses to boost our local economy; help to improve local schools and colleges; work to limit the cost on local schools and colleges; stand up against austerity; try to fight to protect the education budget for all 4-18-year-olds and will work to protect their qualification choices facing cost cuttings; and will focus on housing by helping with the rising cost of living. Bob will back up the Lib Dem £800-a-year initiative for all 120,000 low-earners to work out what the basic rate pension goes every tax year."
