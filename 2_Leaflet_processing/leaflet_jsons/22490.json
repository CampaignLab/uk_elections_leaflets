I've lived in the constituency since 2000, first in Bury and now in Woolpit, and my children are all at school in the constituency. My job as an archaeologist has shown me that society can change over time, and that we don't have to live in the way that we always have. It's up to us to make that change for the better - with courage and conviction we can build a better world.",
