Our local GPs tell me how tough it is to get the support they need from this Tory-led government. Over the next five years, Labour will give an extra Â£2.5 billion over and above existing plans to ensure 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more GPs, and guarantee that we see our GP within 48 hours or a cancer specialist within two weeks. We need to ensure that our NHS can serve us well.'"
