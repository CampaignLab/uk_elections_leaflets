We believe it is important, however, that their real track record and their proposals for our area are understood before voting in the general and local Elections takes place on 6th May. Lambeth Green Party policies include: 1. Opposing the new Herne Hill secondary school built by the Labour Government and Council due to open this year on its permanent site in Shakespeare Road to provide much needed high quality places for Herne Hill children. 2. Blocking the 20 mph Zone for Herne Hill proposed by Labour for this year. They want Herne Hill residents to have to wait until there is a Lambeth and London wide speed limit before we get the measures to slow down traffic that urgently need. 3. Pressing for the legalisation of drugs including skunk cannabis and supergrass. Finally, voting for the Green Party risks allowing the Conservatives - who were in a clear second place here in the London Mayoral elections in 2008 - to win the Constituency and Council elections."
