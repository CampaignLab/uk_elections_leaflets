A graduate in Law, I have had political experience as a Conservative Party Agent for seventeen years. The Tories and other establishment parties are rattled because UKIP is the first credible threat they have faced. The EU combination of big government and big business is crushing our people and our small businesses. A vote for me and UKIP shows your belief in Britain, and desire for change."
