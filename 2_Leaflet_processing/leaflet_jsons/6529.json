Tackle benefit fraud and reform the welfare system so that those who can work do work. Introduce a new tax on the banks allowing lending to happen faster and the economy to recover. Cut the deficit faster than Labour - so we don’t have to spend as much on interest payments. Make the tough decisions like bringing forward the date at which the state pension age starts to rise to 66, freezing public sector pay except for the one million lowest earners, and stopping tax credits to families with incomes over £50,000."
