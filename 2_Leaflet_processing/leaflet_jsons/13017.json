  	{
    	"title": "Standing up for Burton & Uttoxeter",
    	"content": "You will shortly receive your postal vote for the most important General Election Britain has faced for decades. We face a clear choice – five more years of Gordon Brown’s tired government making things worse, or David Cameron and the Conservatives with the energy, leadership and values to get the country moving. Our plan will address what matters to people today, and will sort out Labour’s mess."

    	"policyTitle": "Economy",
    	"policyDescription": "Act now on debt to get the economy moving. We will deal with the deficit more quickly than Labour so that mortgage rates stay lower for longer."

  	{
    	"policyTitle": "Employment",
    	"policyDescription": "Get Britain working by boosting enterprise and tackling the benefits culture. We will cut corporation tax rates, abolish taxes on the first ten jobs created by new businesses in the first two years of a Conservative Government, and get people off welfare and into work."
  	},
  	{
    	"policyTitle": "Family",
    	"policyDescription": "Make Britain the most family-friendly country in Europe. We will recognise marriage in the tax system and remove the penalty that penalises couples in the benefits system."

  	{
    	"policyTitle": "Europe",
    	"policyDescription": "Never allow Britain to slide into a federal Europe. We will pass a law so that any future treaty that hands over further power to the EU would be subject to a referendum of the British people. We will keep the pound and never take the UK into the Euro."
  	},
  	{
    	"policyTitle": "Immigration",
    	"policyDescription": "Control immigration. Britain benefits from immigration, but today it is uncontrolled. So we will place an annual limit on the number of immigrants from outside the EU."
