I have five children and two grandchildren and am a member of a local church. I have served as a local school governor, and parish councillor. A strong supporter of the local opposition to over-development in Colchester, I understand the need to tackle congestion in the town with a common sense approach.\n\nYours sincerely, John Pitts"
