Johnson and Corbyn know little and care less for our nation, it's them, it's the unionists that opt for a better future. Wales needs neither their Brexit, nor their austerity nor their chaos. It needs more of Westminster's chaos, but for a new hope for change. It's us, then. Back Wales, back Plaid Cymru."
