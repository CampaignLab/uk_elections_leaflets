We also need to ensure that we finish the Campaign in a situation where we can support the candidate. To do this we will need the help of our Members and Supporters in the form of deliveries, poster sites, canvassers, tellers on election day, and of course, helpers with our Fund-raising to ensure we can get our message across."
