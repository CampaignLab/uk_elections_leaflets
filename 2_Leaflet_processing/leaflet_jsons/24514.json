I have been active as a trade unionist and socialist all my adult life. The three 'main' parties have consistently let down the poor and dispossessed of those who need a fresh approach to support these people's needs. They didn't cause austerity, they're the people that austerity was caused to. We need investment in social housing and education, a living wage and proper welfare. We need a fairer society to give hope, especially to the young. The Green Party are saying all of this. They are saying that those who can afford it should give more tax. The old system has failed again and again. We need to think differently, only the Green Party is doing that."
