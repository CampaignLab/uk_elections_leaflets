Surely it can't be right that in 2017 in Scarborough & Whitby, many families have to rely on food banks to feed themselves; or that young might need to sell your home to pay for care home costs. This Tory Government has got its priorities wrong, let's send a loud and clear message - vote Labour on 8 June for a country that works for the many, not just a privileged few."

        "content": "The Tories have broken their promise to protect the NHS. A&E targets are missing and the NHS is facing its biggest financial crisis in the UK, with its deficit on record totaling Â£2.45 billion. It is not that there is no funding or extra investment for GPs and a single penny of health and social care the staff are left to look after more and more patients. Waiting lists are expected to jump to 5 million and hospitals remain overcrowded. A&E targets have failed for over 13 weeks and people are working even more hours to be seen."
