I worked as a new homes sales negotiator. Our broken political system has failed to deliver the Brexit that 52 percent of us voted for. Like many, I have lost trust in politics. As your MP I would increase employment opportunities for young people. Whether fighting for Brexit and democracy, or standing up for local people, I will be a strong voice for West Ham."
