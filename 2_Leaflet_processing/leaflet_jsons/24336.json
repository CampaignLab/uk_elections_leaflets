Those who can't work because of disability or serious health problems feel they don't get a fair deal. The highest earners, people on more than £150,000 a year, will pay more tax, while those on lower incomes will pay less. And we'll increase the Minimum Wage to over £8 an hour. That's a fairer way of doing things."
