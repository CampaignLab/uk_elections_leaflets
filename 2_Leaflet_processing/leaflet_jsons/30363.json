Living standards have declined with real wages lower now than they were in 2010. 5.7 million people are in jobs that pay less than the Living Wage, too many of the jobs that are being created are in low-paid, insecure work. They have failed to rule out raising Income Tax and National Insurance contributions for working people. Whilst working people are struggling those at the top have received tens of billions of pounds worth of tax breaks."
