A bright future awaits this community if we could just get a fair break. Well, I'm tired of waiting for the old, stale parties to throw us a few crumbs. This, the most important Election in a 100 years, is where we make our stand. Join me, and 'fight' for that future! You have nothing to lose and everything to gain."
