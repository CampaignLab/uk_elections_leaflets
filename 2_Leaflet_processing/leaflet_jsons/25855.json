UKIP happens to be the only party that is willing to discuss the issues the other parties won't and it brings a refreshing combination of honesty and common sense to British politics. As an author and teacher, I have lived and worked in Bedfordshire all my life. Please visit johnvanweenenukip.co.uk where my 'This is Your Life' will play and you will see the philosophy I bring to UKIP. yours sincerely, John van Weenen MBE"
