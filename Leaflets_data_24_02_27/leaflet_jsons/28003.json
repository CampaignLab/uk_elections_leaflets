                "content": "Adam McGregor is the Green Party candidate for Nottingham South. Adam, 28, is from London and came to the city in 2008 to study at the University of Nottingham. After making Nottingham his home, he has for many years volunteered for his local community and food bank. He has also been involved in activist groups such as the People's Assembly Against Austerity, CND, Stop the War, and Frack Free Notts. Adam is appalled at the way the government has treated young people, selling out their futures on education and the economy, and its extreme Brexit plans. If elected, Adam would push to completely scrap tuition fees and student debt, bring private rents under control, and protect the right to freedom of movement. Over two thousand people voted for Adam in 2015 in Nottingham South. You can join this growing movement for change. Stand up for what matters in 2017. Vote Green."

We have the vision to deliver an alternative future for our country \u2013 and our place in the world. The Green Party offers a different kind of politics. To shape an economy for everyone while preserving a safe environment. To build affordable homes and provide properly funded public services. To put power back in your hands through a citizen's democracy. Every Green vote on 8 June will help make that vision a reality."
