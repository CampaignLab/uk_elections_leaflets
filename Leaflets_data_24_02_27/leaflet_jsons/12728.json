Many of you want a local MP that knows Orpington and who has a history of living in and working for the local area. As someone who has lived in Orpington for over 30 years, attended local schools and has used local services and shops, more and more people are now backing me and the Liberal Democrats to stand up for Orpington."

I know that many residents have been hugely inconvenienced by the works going on there - with buses being held up and pedestrian crossings closed. Is this really \u00a32 million well spent? My priority would be to make it safer, with better street lighting and also to persuade the Council help get more of the empty shops full. Another Liberal Democrat policy would be to make sure that when the Council is causing such massive disruption to a shopping area then they should not be charging people to park while the work is going on."
