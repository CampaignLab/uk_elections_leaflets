Taxpayers' money is still being squandered, even as these vital services are threatened with cuts or even privatisation. Green MPs would block the savage cuts threatened by the other parties. Billions of pounds worth of savings can be made instead by cancelling programmes like Trident replacement. We would also scrap both ID cards and the costly 'database state' that goes with them."

Electing Greens will deliver these jobs of the future in construction, transport and energy, and through investment in local businesses. Our free insulation scheme for every single home in the country would save households hundreds of pounds. Measures like this could deliver tens of thousands of new jobs across Scotland."
