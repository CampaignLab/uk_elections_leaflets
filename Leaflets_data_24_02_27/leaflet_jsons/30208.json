I have worked hard to earn a living and running my own local business, therefore I understand the problems facing the many small enterprises in the area. If elected, I will put the people of this City first above any party politics, striving to raise the profile of S-O-T and working to bring the much needed investment and better paid jobs. I campaigned for the UK to leave the EU believing that we are better off out, as do the majority of people in this great City."
