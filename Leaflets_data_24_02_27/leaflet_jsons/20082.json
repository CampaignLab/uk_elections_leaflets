Living and working in London she can put it all behind her when she goes home, leaving us with a gridlocked urban sprawl. Being local I want to defend Fareham, I was born in Eastleigh and have lived and worked locally all my life. I believe that Fareham needs a local, motivated person with a passion for the area. Let's work together for Fareham."
