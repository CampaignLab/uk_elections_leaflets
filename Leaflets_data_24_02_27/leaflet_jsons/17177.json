I have spent my working life in manufacturing industry, banking and finance. I have also been a company director, but I have also experienced the stress and uncertainty of losing my job. As your MP, I would devote myself full time to representing all my constituents. In 2010, Labour came second in Ribble Valley. This time, letâ€™s go one better.'",
