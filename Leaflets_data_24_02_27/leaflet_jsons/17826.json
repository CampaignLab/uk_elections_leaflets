Well me too - that's why I joined the UKIP. I believe passionately, that the MP's roll is National Service, not Self Service like we've seen from the LibLabCon Expenses Scandal. I want to be that approachable \"roll your sleeves up\" type of MP that you can stop and talk to when I'm in Chelmsford High Street or local pub! It's time for positive change - Vote UKIP!"
