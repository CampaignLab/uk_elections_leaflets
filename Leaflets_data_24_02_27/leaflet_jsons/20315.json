I've seen off developers, our Green Belt in Nuthall and fought hard to attend to it in Awsworth. I've stood by residents in Kimberley and Stapleford. I've got compensation funds for businesses in Beeston blighted by the tram works. We need to chill the economic opportunity of our growing economy in one of our great towns like Beeston."
