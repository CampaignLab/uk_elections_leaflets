It is time for a free-thinking MP who will do what is right for the area and never vote for anything which is detrimental to the future of the constituency. Fleetwood needs urgent financial assistance to rebuild and regenerate the town. Lancaster is the jewel of the north, yet it is ignored by political parties and politicians whose only interest is filling their own pockets.",
