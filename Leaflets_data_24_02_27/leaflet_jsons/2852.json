Conservatives have many immediate policies to help with the \u2018Brown\u2019 recession and ongoing policy to outline these policies and the longer term view. Locally, it is important that we start to think about how Wyre Forest can come out of this recession with a better and stronger local economy. Certainly, there is much cultivation to do. I think we should all encourage people to holiday at home this year, whilst Britain can expect to see more overseas visitors enjoying the cheap pound. With more visitors in world class tourist attractions, there is certainly an opportunity that we will see an increase in visitors to our district - visitors who will bring much needed cash into our local economy."
