Note: The actual party leader is not directly named in the text and neither are the tactical voting concerns other than the mention of UKIP, so those sections are left blank. Additionally, no quotes or endorsements are present. The contact information, website, social media, political experience, and quotes from the leaflet provided are not fully detailed, so they are represented as such in the JSON.
