However, we all agree that for the people of London, as with the people of Britain, to see the best from our Country, we all need to have control over our lives, our society and our laws. I joined UKIP to achieve these goals. I vote UKIP so to place decision making back in the hands of the people of Britain. Only local people can make the right decisions locally, tackling local issues. As your MP I will place your needs first, giving you that voice.",
