Whether it's your concerns about health provision, cuts to your services, or uncontrolled immigration – the other parties are just not listening. I believe the area needs a local champion who understands the problems our area faces and will stand up for our Flintshire. My team and I have helped people right across Flintshire. We are helping people who haven’t had the help they need from their MP or from councillors of other parties. We are here to help you. UKIP believes in action – not words. If I can help you then don’t hesitate to contact me personally on 0772 2441718 or nigel@ukipdelyn.org. Kind regards, Nigel Nigel Williams P.S. You don’t just hear from us at election time we are working for you all the time."
