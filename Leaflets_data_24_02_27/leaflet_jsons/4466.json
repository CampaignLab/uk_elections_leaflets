Many hard working Coventry families still feel the effects of the recession and fear what is yet to come. There are great problems that must be tackled, not least the massive Government debt, but there are also many opportunities. I am passionate about Coventry and its people. I am not afraid to be a changed government, with a new MP in this constituency, Coventry can be at the forefront again."

We need to mend our broken society and rebuild trust in our political system. We can't go on like this. Britain needs change to get the country back on its feet - to heal the mistakes of the past and bring new ideas and energy for our future. This can be the year for change â€“ and the Conservatives have the plans to make that a reality."
