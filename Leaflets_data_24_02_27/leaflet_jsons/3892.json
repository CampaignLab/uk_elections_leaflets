        "content": "Millions of people had high hopes when Labour got elected in 1997. But the truth is that this Government hasn't made Britain a fairer society. The gap between the rich and the poor has grown, we've still got old people who can't heat their homes when it's cold, and the school system is letting too many children down. We can't go on like this."

We will Get Britain Working by creating 450,000 new apprenticeships, college and training places over two years. As part of our plan to build a more balanced economy, where Britain makes things again, new businesses will pay no tax on the first ten jobs they create."
