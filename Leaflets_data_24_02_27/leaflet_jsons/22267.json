Your vote here in Wales will make a difference, as to who will be the Prime Minister for the UK \u2013 David Cameron or Ed Miliband.\nOne of main issues affecting people in Wales is our Welsh NHS. I am proud of the dedication and hard work of everyone who works in the NHS. My wife worked in the NHS for 20 years and I know first-hand the passion and commitment that her and her former colleagues showed day in, day out despite enormous pressure and heart-breaking situations. Meeting people across Wales, they have the utmost praise for them and we must give the staff our 100% support."
