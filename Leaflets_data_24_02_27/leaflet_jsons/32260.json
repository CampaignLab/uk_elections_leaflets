I’m driven by a desire to help sick people get better. But during my six years as an NHS psychiatrist, it’s become clear to me there is an imbalance at the heart of the way our NHS treats patients. For far too long mental health has been put on the back-burner and I’m frightened by this. I’m frightened for all the young people unable to access adequate services and I’m frightened that patients all too often turned away."

That’s why I’m backing the Liberal Democrats in this election. Their plan to put mental health on an equal footing with physical health, ensuring treatment is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, will ensure we have the mental health service and care Britain needs."
