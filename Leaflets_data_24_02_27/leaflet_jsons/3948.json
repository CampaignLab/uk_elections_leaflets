Their priority is to give a tax cut to the 3,000 wealthiest people in the country\u2014whilst cutting 1 in 5 Sure Start centres. Islington Labour Is different. Our priority is to make our borough fairer. Although Labour does not run the Council, we have successfully fought for Free school meals, More affordable housing, Local jobs and Council apprenticeships. Only Labour has a plan to make our borough fairer. Please read our priorities. As your local Labour team, we ask for your support on May 6th. Best wishes."
