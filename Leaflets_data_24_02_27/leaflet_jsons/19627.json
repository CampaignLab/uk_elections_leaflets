They say they are fed up with politicians in general. Some have given up voting altogether because of this. People say they want a change but don\u2019t know who to try. Many others say they vote Green because of the work we do and that we are the only party they see doing anything in their area."

I ask you to please consider a different way forward and support me in the General Election on 7th May 2015. Thank you."
