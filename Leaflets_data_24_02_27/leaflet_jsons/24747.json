Afzal or chaos under Labour with higher taxes, more borrowing and more debt. The last five years have seen a massive Government boost for Manchester with extending Metrolink, major investment in higher education buildings, a regional hub promoting Manchester as a global hub. I believe the Conservative Party is best placed to create jobs and improve living standards by building on an economic plan that is working and that has produced the highest employment rate in history."
