TTIP would allow corporations to sue governments for any legislation that would limit their anticipated future profits. This includes environmental and social legislation, and any attempt to reverse the privatisation of the NHS or to bring the railways back into public ownership could thus be overturned by non-democratic courts. The Green Party is the only major political party to oppose this undemocratic deal."
