This contract sets out exactly what you can expect from the next Labour government, and it will allow you to hold us to account too. Our plan is based on a simple truth: that Britain only succeeds when working people succeed. Our contract will ensure we cut the deficit every year. We will not borrow a single extra penny to fund our manifesto commitments. The Tory plan is failing working people because it puts a privileged few first. Labour has a better plan: [Key policies] I have also included a card for you to keep and hold me to account. Our contract means we will secure the future of our NHS. You may have heard in the news recently that the Tories are planning extreme cuts which threaten the survival of the NHS as we know it. This plan for extreme cuts would be a disaster for working families, and I want you to know that is something a Labour government would never do. Labour has a better plan - a plan for a better future for you and your family. Together, we can build a better Britain."
