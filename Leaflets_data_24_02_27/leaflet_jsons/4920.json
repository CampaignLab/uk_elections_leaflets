They came fourth in the 2009 council elections here, behind even the Green Party. At the last General Election, newspapers like the Daily Mail suggested that people who naturally support the Conservatives should support the Lib Dems in Bristol West. This is likely to be their advice again this time... and it worked in 2005!"
