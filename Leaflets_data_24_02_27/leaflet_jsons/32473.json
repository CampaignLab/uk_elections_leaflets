Many decent Labour members have quit in disgust- including Riverside's hard working local MP Louise Ellman - who has walked away from Labour after 55 years of service. I know many local people are appalled and outraged at the way Labour have treated her. I want to thank Louise for all her hard work as our MP, and for standing up for our city against a Tory & Labour backed Brexit. 73% of voters in this constituency want to remain in Europe. As your MP I will build on her record as a true champion for Liverpool.",
