The Lib Dems want open borders, which equals more housing developments, longer waits for GP appointments, more congested roads and trains, and compressed wages. Meanwhile the Tories are threatening school budgets, policing has been cut, and our roads are a disgrace. Meanwhile they are wasting our money on their Foreign Aid vanity project. As a UKIP MP, I will always act in Britain's interests, support local people and businesses. No-one else will!"
