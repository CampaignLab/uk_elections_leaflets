They don\u2019t regard a bit of wet as a reason not to go...I think they are right, although it\u2019s definitely better when the sun shines. This is a wonderful part of the country and I would dearly love to make sure that it not only stays that way but gets better. I grew up just along the road in Southampton and have been coming to Bournemouth all my life. I have family based in the town and have experienced both the best and worst of our local services.",
