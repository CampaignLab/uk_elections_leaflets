I chose to stand in the 2015 general election because I believe politics should be about everyone being able to bring about positive change in their communities. The Green Party works for ordinary people not for the interests of big corporations or rich donors and we are committed to changing British politics for the benefit of all. We need a sea-change in politics and now is the time to come together to face our social, economic and environmental challenges with a positive vision for the future."
