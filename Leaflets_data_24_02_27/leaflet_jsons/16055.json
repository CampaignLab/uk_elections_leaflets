Now I'm determined to keep it safe from the privatisation agenda of the Westminster parties and the knock-on effect this funding vacuum would have through SNP cuts in Scotland. With strong SNP voices in Westminster we can protect our health service. And, in Scotland, we'll never stop doing our best to make our NHS healthier still."
