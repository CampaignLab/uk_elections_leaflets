We can't come through the collective trauma of Covid and go back to the old arguments. Arguing with each other while our NHS loses funding, our children miss out on a world-class education, businesses close and jobs go overseas. Instead, under my leadership of Scottish Labour, we will focus on what unites us as a country - not what divides us. Focusing on uniting our people and helping our nation recover."
