Five years on, Britain is now one of the fastest growing major economies in the world. We are getting our national finances back under control. We have halved our deficit as a share of our economy. More people are in work than ever before."

And this isn’t just because he and Labour haven’t learnt any lessons on the economy since leaving behind that note five years ago.\n\nThe most troubling reality of Mr. Miliband is that the only way he can become Prime Minister is with the backing of the Scottish National Party – giving Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond an effective veto over anything the UK Prime Minister does."
