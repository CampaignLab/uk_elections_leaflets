Over the years, I've seen change for the better in Wirral \u2013 rebuilt schools, and better hospitals for example. But the past year has been hard for some. That's why I want to be your MP: to stand up for our area on the issues that matter. Please get in touch, or even if you like help or want to share your views. Best wishes, Alison"

Our smaller businesses especially are the continued support for the services they provide.

I support the Government's plans to introduce a National Care Service, which will make it easier for people to access help and care, and provide preventative services to help people stay independent for longer. It also believes that care workers require care and support, by giving them the right to flexible working."

If I were selected as your MP, I would continue to meet stakeholders together with the council and public agencies to identify job creation and major new growth that takes our great strength, the local economy to boost manufacturing."

They need practical experience and training for skilled jobs to help them build financial security for the future and contribute to a strong economy. I was proud to work for Network Rail, who introduced one of the largest engineering apprenticeships in the UK. We must campaign for more employers to follow suit. 380 young people were helped into apprenticeships last year in Wirral South and I'm calling for a doubling of apprenticeships available to young people on the Wirral."

We have first rate facilities on our doorstep, like the Lady Lever Art Gallery and the Festival. I believe public sector support for culture and sport encourages excellence and innovation. We have a responsibility to preserve our heritage and promote participation in culture and sport in our communities to develop their skills, which is why I will continue to support these sectors."
