We forced Osborne to bring in an £800 tax cut for 25 million earners. Protected pupil premiums of £2.5 billion a year and free school meals for younger children. Increased the NHS budget, with 6,000 more doctors than in 2010. Our PROMISE OF MORE: We will finish the job of balancing the books, as fairly as possible. The richest should pay more. Cut Income Tax by a further £400 for ordinary workers. We'll protect education spending and equality of opportunity. We oppose two tier exams or schools. We'll raise NHS spending by £8bn & guarantee mental health equality."
