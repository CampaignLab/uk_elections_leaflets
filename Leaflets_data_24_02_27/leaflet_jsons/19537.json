The most important election in 100 years, this is your chance to take back control of our country from the Metro elite who don't listen to your concerns, have never had a real job, and will say anything to get your votes. UKIP is a vote for common sense, a vote to stop your tax being wasted by the EU. Vote UKIP to put £3 Billion into the NHS, and to stop unlimited and unchecked immigration. UKIP will support our farmers and recover our fishing industry. Please, I need your vote to help bring change to Bristol NW."
