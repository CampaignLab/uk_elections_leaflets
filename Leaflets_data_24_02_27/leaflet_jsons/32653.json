                "content": "Dear Voter, My name is Andrew Murday and I am standing as the Liberal Democrat candidate for Skipton and Ripon in the general election. I have lived in Nidderdale for the past 10 years, where I have a smallholding. As a heart surgeon I worked for nearly forty years in the NHS. My experience showed me that, at its best, the NHS is outstanding. But to be so it needs a government that prioritizes its funding. Liberal Democrats will spend an extra \u00a36 billion annually, raised from income tax, to ensure the NHS is adequately funded. My time in the NHS also showed me the value of collaboration with our European neighbours. Leaving the EU will destroy this close working relationship. Understandably people are fed up with Brexit; they want an end to it. But if we leave, with or without a deal, there will be many years spent negotiating new agreements throughout the world with all the political wrangles that will entail. There is only one way of putting an end to this mess and that is to stop Brexit, which is what Liberal Democrats have consistently argued. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have taken their parties to the extreme political right and left respectively. Britain is a liberal country and that spirit of liberalism can be preserved by electing a Liberal Democrat government. Our constituency, which is geographically the largest and one of the most rural in England, has suffered particularly from lack of investment in our rural communities. Liberal Democrat policies will redress this imbalance. I hope to meet you in the course of the election campaign, but if not then feel free to contact me at info@skiptonriponlibdems.org.uk. Best wishes, Andrew Murday"
