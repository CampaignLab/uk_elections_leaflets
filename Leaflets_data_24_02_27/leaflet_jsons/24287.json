I was born on Tyneside, I live in Newcastle upon Tyne where I practice as a lawyer. I strongly believe in the people of this city and that they deserve to have a voice. The way to achieve this is to break free from the one party state that Newcastle has become. You have the power on May 7th and I will work tirelessly for you."
