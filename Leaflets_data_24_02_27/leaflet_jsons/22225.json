You tell me that you are not being listened to by the people making big decisions which affect your family, your finances and the place you live. I want to change that. That's why I've been going door-to-door, street-by-street and organising community meetings right across the constituency: to listen to you. That's the sort of MP I would be - not voting in parliament against local people's interests but getting things done, doing what you want me to do."
