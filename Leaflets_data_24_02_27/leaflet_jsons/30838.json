'Brexit means Brexit,' \u2013 Emmaus of the 'People'; 'Remoaners,' After finally triggering Article 50, our 'strong and stable' (her words) PM decided we waste the first two months of negotiations on a general election she dithered over and should have called last summer. The Tories have no strategy for Brexit and are making it up as they go along. They have fought a terrible campaign full of gaffes, ... This election is about \u2013 silencing opposition. Don't let them silence you. Labour have abandoned the field and signed up fully to Tory Brexit plans. Your MP voted with Corbyn and the Conservatives for Article 50, thus destroying his own principles and priorities he claimed to vote for in 2015. A vote for Labour is a vote for matters to continue as is. It's becoming clear now that the likely outcome of the Brexit negotiations will lead to a severe undermining of all that makes our nation so great \u2013 the UK off a cliff edge. That's why we need a strong, liberal and well \u2013 deal. We need the chance to say NO. Right now, we've signed a blank piece of paper and are asking EU leaders to fill in the terms of our exit. The Liberal Democrats believe Britain is better off in the EU, and we still do. You have the opportunity to stay in the Single Market and chance to have the final say on the Brexit deal. Voting for a Liberal Democrat isn't the start of morning to chance to vote 'no' to Brexit or yes to dealing with it. This could be your last opportunity to vote against Corbyn and May's job-destroying Brexit. Don't be silenced! Vote LibDem on 8th June."
