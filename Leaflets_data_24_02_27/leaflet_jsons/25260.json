I hold the area close to my heart—as did my father who previously campaigned to save Battersea Town Hall (Battersea Arts Centre) from demolition by a Labour led council in the 60’s. I am now fighting to save Battersea Sports Centre from being closed and uprooted by the Conservatives. Legislation can be introduced to ensure affordable housing for all, care and dignity for the vulnerable and address education issues. Vote and trust in me on 7th May to uphold our democracy."
