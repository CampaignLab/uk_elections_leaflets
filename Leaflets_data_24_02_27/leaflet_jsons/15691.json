That was the legacy of Gordon Brown\u2019s Labour government for you and me and our families. Since then the Prime Minister and his team have been working to clean up the mess. We\u2019ve made some difficult decisions and put in place a long-term economic plan. Now, thanks to the hard work and determination of the British people, we are making our way back: new businesses are opening, jobs are being created and families can look forward to a better, more secure future."
