I'm an Edinburgh native who's lived in Leith since 2007 and I am asking for your vote. Why? It's simple; I want to win. More to the point, I want you to win. EVERY OTHER PARTY wants to tell you what to do. UKIP would rather you told us what to do. It's your choice. Kneel to the quangocrats and the satraps of SNP Labour pro-EU officialdom. Or stand as a nation free and proud."
