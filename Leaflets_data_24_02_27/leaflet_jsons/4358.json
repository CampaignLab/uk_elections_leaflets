Many residents have lost their jobs and those who have not, live in fear that they will. We need to get Wolverhampton working again. Our vital local services need protecting. I will stand up for our doctors and nurses, our police officers and for our teachers. They should not be making the decisions, not faceless paper pushers who have never spent any time in a hospital or class room or on the beat."
