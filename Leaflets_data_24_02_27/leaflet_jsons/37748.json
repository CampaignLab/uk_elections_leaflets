We'll increase the NHS budget in each and every year of the next parliament, and build five new flagship centres to reduce waiting times in key elective specialties. We'll deliver 30,000 new apprenticeships each year by 2021, retain the small business bonus, and back enterprise to create jobs and put more into pay packets. We'll build 50,000 affordable homes, help more families own their home with interest-free equity loans, and make private renting fairer. We'll use new Holyrood powers to better support the most vulnerable in society, and protect pensioner benefits like free bus travel and free personal care."
