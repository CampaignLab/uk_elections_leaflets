If you're struggling and trying to get on, the way the benefits system works means that as much as 90p of every pound you earn disappears in tax and lost benefits. 'Working a 40-hour week on minimum wage, you'd just be £23 better off is no incentive, no wonder people feel trapped. We need to reform the tax system to make work pay.'",
