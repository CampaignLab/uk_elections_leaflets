For years our Government, firstly the Conservatives and then Labour, have followed economic policies which favour the interests of multinational corporations over those of ordinary people. But these policies are unsustainable, putting short term profits for a tiny elite before the long terms needs of the people and the planet."

There would also be investment in the public infrastructure such as hospitals and schools. The Greens believe economics should work for, not against, the people."
