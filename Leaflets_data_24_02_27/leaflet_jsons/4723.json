For the first time London elected a Conservative Mayor, Boris Johnson, and re-elected Conservative Brian Coleman to represent Camden on the Assembly. The results from the European Parliament Elections here in Holborn & St Pancras show that there's all to play for in this area. The choice at the next election is simple - five more years of Gordon Brown or a fresh start under the Conservatives."
