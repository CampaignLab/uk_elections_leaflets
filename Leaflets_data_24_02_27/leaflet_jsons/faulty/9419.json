I think that is just a great objective to have – and I believe Conservative policies on family, especially on flexible working, are the best thing for my future and for my children's future.'"

But I saw David Cameron on TV talking about how we need to encourage families and communities and build up constituencies – and 'Yeah - that's what I think about.' And the Conservative plans to widen communities and let them take their destinies into their own hands is why I'll be voting for them at the next election.'"

But having children has changed my outlook. I want a government that can ensure that I can provide for my family – and I think the Conservatives will do that.'"
