As somebody who was born and bred locally, I know the issues we face and how they affect people like you and me. I've led the campaign to save our NHS locally, I've successfully fought for better public transport and services, and I really want to be able to do a lot more. To do this, I need you to send me to Parliament as your MP, and together, we CAN make a difference!!"
