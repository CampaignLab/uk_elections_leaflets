        "content": "My father arrived in this country from Nigeria in the 1960s and supported Labour until his death. Why? - Because the Labour Party was set up to look after hard working people, not just the wealthy and privileged - when my father came here, work was what he wanted to do, and the Labour Party believes everyone here and in the labour market for all continues today here and abroad - In 2003 Labour enacted laws to prevent people being discriminated at work on the grounds of their religion - as a solicitor I have used this to protect people of faith from discrimination."
