With Labour more desperate than ever, voters are on their guard for more Labour lies and smears. People won’t be fooled by these dodgy Labour tactics. It shows how ashamed Labour must be of their thirteen year record if that’s the best they can do. Remember the choice in many parts of Wales is between the Liberal Democrats and Labour. Only the Liberal Democrats will deliver real change and a fairer Wales."
