    "personalStatement": "I'm a local teacher who's lived in Huddersfield for 30 years. My children were born in the HRI and went to local state schools. My Dad was a miner, a nurse and a teacher. I believe it's through education that people, without money or privilege, can thrive. I'm committed to improving the way we live. My priorities are our children, the best, to give our children the greatest possible chance in life. As a user of the NHS, I want to defend the NHS, for all our citizens and to create more high-skilled, high-paying local jobs.",
