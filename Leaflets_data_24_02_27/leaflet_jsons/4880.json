I will fight for more resources for Darlington schools, colleges and health services. I will work with Durham Government for more backing for our police and for robust sentencing of criminals. I will tackle anti-social behaviour. I will back strict rules on immigration and work to get many more people off benefits and into a job. I will work with business to bring high quality jobs to Darlington so the town never again suffers the unemployment of the 1980's."
