I believe in this country and know people are feeling let down by the other parties. Once we leave the EU Britain will prosper. We can start to rebuild our universities, creating a society that enables everyone to achieve their potential. We can enter world trade agreements and can manage our own destiny by developing social and democratic structures for us, not the EU."

This means the burden in cuts in services that people rely on is aimed at Councils rather than the government. This Coalition Government has seen more interference in local authorities than any previous government. Local people should be able to decide local priorities - not Westminster politicians."
