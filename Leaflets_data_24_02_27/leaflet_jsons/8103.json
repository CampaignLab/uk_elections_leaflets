                "content": "JOAN is backing continued commitment to older people which has seen major steps forward under the current Labour Government: Winter fuel payments are here to stay. There is still more to do so much to improve quality of life for older people but massive steps forward like: free bus passes have improved significantly their mobility, their free tv licence, their free prescriptions and free eye tests and there are free influenza jabs for millions of pensioners over 75. The poorest pensioners are better off as Labour has lifted a million older people out of poverty, and the number of pensioners claiming pension credit is by a million since its introduction. Labour has legislated to restore the link between pensions and earnings within the next parliament. The \u00a310m Heroes Return Scheme enables Second World War veterans to go back to the areas where they saw active service, while the covenant has secured \u00a310,000 for each veteran held captive by the Japanese during the war."
