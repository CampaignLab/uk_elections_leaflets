If I've met you on the doorstep, at one of our public meetings or while commuting, it's likely you have a similar story. My father and grandparents lived in Battersea. They brought up five children. My mother took the broken pieces of the same family to live close by. Housing is the number one issue people talk to me about. One in ten households move every year. One in six grew up in social housing in the same family homes their parents did. But there are local people I've known that are locked into different contracts to hundreds of possible agents and know that the price of local rent could rise again tomorrow."
