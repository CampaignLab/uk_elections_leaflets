I have listened to what you care about. Every conversation I have helps complete the picture of what matters most to you. Together we can achieve real change for the area and why the decisions made for the area need a strong champion for the local community."

It's great people are finding schools make great places to live. But I also know many people tell me how their child cannot hope to afford making a future for itself here. We've emptied family homes as the cost of transport, rent, lack of investment in public services and rising living standards have risen. Many like me, have made a home for themselves but have seen that home's value increase by over one and a quarter per cent every week. It's tougher and more expensive than ever to buy here and rent prices have risen by no less than 8%.",

You deserve better services here in Hertford and Stortford where no one is left behind. I want to work together to achieve it.",
