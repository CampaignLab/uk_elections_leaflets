It's got harder to see your GP, with one in four people waiting a week or more, or not getting an appointment at all. Waiting lists have soared. Nearly 3.9 million people in England are waiting for treatment. Hospitals in England ended 2015/2016 £2.45 billion in deficit, the worst on record. The Tories stated ambition to top down reorganisation in the 2010-2015 parliament. £4.6 billion was cut from social care budgets in the 2010-2015 parliament."
