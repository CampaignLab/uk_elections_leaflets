Change with Labour - built on fairness, securing the recovery, protecting schools and the NHS, helping families and investing in jobs for the future. Or change with the Tories who will reduce spending now and damage the recovery, cut tax credits for families, take away the cancer treatment guarantee and give inheritance tax reductions to the richest. How we cast our vote in this election will make a big difference to our future."
