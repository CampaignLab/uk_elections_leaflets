Successive governments have neglected British people, leaving young people with tuition fees debt, uncontrolled mass immigration, an under-resourced police force, NHS at breaking point, libraries closing down, thousands depending upon food banks and elderly freezing in winter. Yet we pay \u00a355 million per day to the EU and \u00a312 billion a year in foreign aid. Does this make sense to you? I am asking for your vote, to represent and work for you in Luton South."
