Labour will freeze business rates and energy bills for households, and small and medium enterprises. We will prioritise flood prevention and introduce a new climate adaptation plan. We will decentralise our electricity supply by 2030, and strengthen the Green Investment Bank."

We will cut tuition fees to \u00a36,000, guarantee apprenticeships for every school leaver with the basic grades, as well as smaller class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds."

Labour will provide 25 hours free childcare each week to all working parents, saving the average family more than \u00a3100 a week. Labour's plan will be paid for by a tax on the banks - the equivalent of the market value of two average houses, so that working families can take time off."

This investment in our health service will be funded by a clamp down on tax avoidance, a levy on tobacco firms and a Mansion Tax. The Tories have put private profit before patient care and left our A&E departments facing the worst crisis since records began."
