I believe the people of this great constituency have been failed by their councils and they've been failed by their Government. We need to stop looking to the mainstream political parties for change. We need a true alternative. That is why I am standing as UKIP's candidate. I am not a career politician, I am not funded by big corporations or Unions. I am a working class man who only wants to serve the people. I stand for you."
