We have used local services from schools to community care which means that I have a first-hand knowledge and understanding. I have been involved with local voluntary organisations for over 20 years ranging from Convenor of The Community Council, to founding member of a Youth Club and East Dunbartonshire Children's Panel Advisory Committee. MSP for the West of Scotland, covering East Dunbartonshire from 2007 to 2013. You can depend on me to always work for the best interests of our towns and villages. After the 2007 election I met so many people who said they'd ticked-off voting SNP and now wished they had. Now you can make that crucial decision based on the SNP Government's proud record of achievements and our vision for a better future for Scotland. Yours for Scotland Fiona",
