        "content": "1. Ben is the only candidate representing change you can trust with David Cameron. Voting for any other candidate helps Gordon Brown stay as Prime Minister for 5 more years. 2. Ben is fully committed to our area, living locally and active in our community - Governor of Bramhall High School; campaigning for improved commuter travel; coaching local youth rugby. 3. Ben has real life experience of our Public Services - ten years as a teacher, the son and grandson of nurses and with experience of working in NHS."
