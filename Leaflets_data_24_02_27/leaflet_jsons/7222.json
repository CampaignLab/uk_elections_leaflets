I support a written constitution for the United Kingdom which should be created by the people, not just politicians.\nInvestment and employment, not immediate cuts\nI will oppose cuts which put our economic recovery at risk and punish ordinary people for the recession. Where cuts are needed, I will support 'efficiency savings' which do not adversely affect jobs and services.\nPublic services not private profit\nI will campaign now to maintain investment in health, education and housing. I will also campaign for utilities and the railways to be made more accountable to both customers and passengers.\nBanks responsible to society\nI want to see banks organised so they deliver real benefits to society rather than just to their shareholders. I will support local credit unions, giving people an alternative to rogue lenders, and action to better regulate banks and hedge funds.\nEducation for the many not the few\nI support a truly comprehensive education system giving our young people a real choice between vocational and academic subjects on the same premises. I will also campaign for lower class sizes."
