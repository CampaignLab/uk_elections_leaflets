Nicola Sturgeon should get back to the day job of investing in our schools, improving our public services and sorting out our NHS.\n\nI will fight for a better deal for our pensioners. I will vote to protect the Triple-Lock on state pensions and to deliver justice for the WASPI women.\n\nI will seek more investment for Dunfermline and West Fife to create jobs and opportunities, including a mixed use Rosyth Waterfront and railway links for Kincardine and Halbeath.\n\nI will fight for the replacement of Woodmill, St Columba's and Inverkeithing High Schools with the modern state of the art facilities our children need and deserve.\n\nI will always put Dunfermline & West Fife first. Our area needs a local champion who will work for the many, not the few, and fight a second independence referendum."
