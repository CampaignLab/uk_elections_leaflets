I've been with UKIP for 7 years now and I'm standing for UKIP because I believe, contrary to what you might have heard, that this country faces multiple crises on many fronts and I think it's time we elected representatives who believe in meaningful change who will set our country back on the right track. I believe in Britain, if you do too, vote UKIP in 2015."
