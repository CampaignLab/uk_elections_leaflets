But, because of unprecedented budget cuts by the Tory/Lib Dem Government, North Tyneside has struggled to maintain services. LABOUR in Government will pass an English Devolution Bill, transferring \u00a330bn, giving local communities more power to address local priorities and grow their economy."

I was pleased to play my part in helping OGN bring nearly 2000 jobs to Wallsend. We have excellent companies across the constituency, but growth must derive from Government jobs strategy. I want to create worthwhile new apprenticeships. LABOUR has ambitious plans to increase apprenticeships throughout the industry and establish a Minimum Wage enforcement machine, in addition to a British Investment Bank."

The vast majority of these campaigns were against the Government's cuts to jobs and services, such as the regrettable closure of the country's Remploy factories. The campaign to save the 2nd Royal Regiment of Fusiliers from being disbanded because of Government Defence cuts, did huge local support but the Government ignored a vote in the Commons to save the Battalion. Labour will conduct a Strategic Defence Review based on defence needs not just on making cuts."
