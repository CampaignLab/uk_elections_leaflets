They got the EU referendum wrong, and as Jeremy Corbyn has said himself, he was a 200-1 outside chance for the Labour leadership. So in the days of shock election results and global uncertainty, no one can ever really be sure who will win. And with so much at stake, let's not risk it."

Making Brexit a success is central to our national interest \u2013 and it is central to your own security and prosperity. While there is enormous opportunity for Britain as we leave the European Union, if we do not get this right the consequences will be serious. And they will be felt by ordinary, working people across the country. If we don't get the Brexit deal right, your economic security and prosperity will be put at risk, and the opportunities you seek for your family will simply not happen."

That means delivering better paying jobs, more affordable housing, a good school place for every child, and a strong economy paying for a strong NHS. But our opponents are already seeking to ruin our chances of getting the best Brexit deal. That is why I took the decision to call a General Election for June \u2013 to ask for your backing, so that when I am sitting around the table with the leaders of the 27 other EU countries I have the strongest negotiating hand possible."

Or a hung parliament and coalition of chaos with Jeremy Corbyn, threatening our Brexit negotiations, and every single one of us will pay for it in higher taxes, fewer jobs, more waste and more debt."

The choice voters face is framed as being between strong and stable leadership or a hung parliament and 'coalition of chaos' with Jeremy Corbyn."
