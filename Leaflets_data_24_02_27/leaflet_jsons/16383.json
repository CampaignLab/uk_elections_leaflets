I'm chair of Governors at Milton Park primary School and Meon Junior School as well as Director on the board of the Lighthouse Learning Trust. I'm a passionate sailor, when I can find time to take to the water. I love living in Portsmouth. I love the people and all of this city's diverse areas and communities. It's a great place to live and work, and I want to be a powerful voice for Portsmouth in Parliament."

I'm delighted to be outing myself forward to be the next MP for Portsmouth South, and I am enjoying a CV on which I think I'm the best candidate for the job. I have a long history with Portsmouth and with the Royal Navy. Gunwharf Quays was built over the HMS Vernon, named after one of my relatives, Admiral Edward Vernon. I've lived and worked here in the city for many years and am proud to have been the leader of Portsmouth City Council for ten years."

With your support, I fought for the new 8-lane Bassin road, after the previous Labour-government scheme closure, and have ensured the two new aircraft carriers will be home-ported here, securing thousands of jobs for the next 50 years. As Council Leader, I was also able to find \u00a35 million to create a further 1,000 primary school places in our city. I have also been a leading voice for our area nationally. While the Conservatives were trying to force through damaging tax cuts for millionaires and allowing private companies to run schools for a profit, I worked across party on Portsmouth to work with Ministers of all parties to bring \u00a348 million to Portsmouth to create new jobs and homes through the City Deal."
