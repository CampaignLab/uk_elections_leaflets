What the town centre needs is a wide variety of independent shops with a high street greengrocer and butcher back amongst them. The Treacle Market proves there are huge numbers of local traders keen to trade in Macclesfield, it's the high rates and rents plus parking charges that have killed off the shops and put new ones off opening."

Born in Manchester I grew up in Cheadle Hulme attending the local comprehensive school, first coming to Macclesfield in the 80's, so I remember the vibrant town centre it once was. I have lived in the town for 7 years with my fianc√©e Jane and our daughter who attends a local primary school.",
