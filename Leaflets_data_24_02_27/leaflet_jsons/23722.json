I've been a member of the Green Party for thirty years. I have never wanted to vote anything other than Green - everything about the party makes perfect sense to me. The values, together with the kiowledge of the philosophies and concerns and the longterm view that the Green Party stretches all around the world, make me know that I'm involved in something very worthwhile.\n\nThe North East (and the world) needs the Green Party more than ever. Please look into our policies and if you believe, as I do, that we are really getting thuns from the environment to make very positive changes, then vote for us.\nSomeone once told me \"The only wasted vote is a vote you don't believe in\".\nPlease don't waste your vote."
