Claimed over \u00a313,000 for food in just 48 months AND pocketed over \u00a319,000 for resigning as a minister twice! Voted to charge local kids \u00a33000 a year to go to university (but she went to university for free). Voted to cut benefits to lone parents & the disabled. Was in charge of the department that lost child benefit data for every family in Britain. Voted for nuclear power and more nuclear weapons. Voted to waste \u00a3BILLIONS on ID cards & the 10p tax rate. As a Treasury Minister, she defended axing the 10p tax rate that could turn local families up to \u00a3446 worse off. FAILED to turn up for a crucial public poverty vote that would allow local families to \u00a3662 a year better off. Voted to allow you to be locked up for 3 months without a trial AND voted for the war in Iraq. "
