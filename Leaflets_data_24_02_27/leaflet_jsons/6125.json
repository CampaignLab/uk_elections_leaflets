[...] Many would suggest that leaving school with only one GCSE and as a teenage single mother would not be the best start to life. However, I sincerely hope that my story shows that individual hard work can achieve results irrespective of your background. [...] I want to be a driving force in society, a positive disruptive force sharing my story of change in individual lives to a national level."
